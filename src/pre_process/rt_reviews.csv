f79mh4i2mRu36krLAxPD6A,2010-11-04,4,,"This Ruby Tuesday is in a strip mall at the corner of Routes 3 and 372. Parking seemed adequate when we were there but I'm not sure how it is when the restaurant is busy. What am I saying? Ruby Tuesday is never busy.This is a typical Ruby Tuesday where the all-you-can-eat salad bar is the prime attraction and is far more interesting than any of the entrees. If you go to Ruby Tuesday, I recommend ordering one of the mini sandwich combos with the salad bar because that's only a dollar more than ordering the salad bar as an entree. The restaurant interior decor is low key, comfortable and boring, the standard for this restaurant chain. Restrooms were kept in good shape, as far as I could tell. Service was pretty good.",https://www.yelp.com?hrid=f79mh4i2mRu36krLAxPD6A,en,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/RRt5qFvir7LIfsDT_dLqLQ/60s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=cFaHx-FkCnzdfF8BccukIg,Morton F.,"New Castle, DE",988,1,0,0,null,null,null,null,vbNum3mSE3iUA__fnvDBzw
ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,2022-07-23,1,,"Ruby Tuesday's was a treat back in the day (It may have been a Tuesday)Not today. Boy was this sad. I was bummed at first sight.The place looked like the 90's called and wanted everything in the place back like stuck in 35 years ago kind of feel and look. The attempts to promote are a nice effort but seems so over blown ""Win a Million Dollars!"" But the risk is maybe ruin your health or get sick or just plain waste your money on substandard food? So our ""meal"" was not good from start to finish. The staff needs some real training. The training videos don't seem to be translating into real life results. The thing that struck me was how can you be happy if the place is always kinda empty and the staff keeps getting cut and makes no money? Take that million from the contest and apply it to the staff and getting the place really revived to today's dining needs. The Salad bar is a throwback feel but an area that could be modernized and improved to be actually healthy but I am not sure that this is that certain something special that the diner of today will respond to so strongly that it will resonate as ""Special."" This is where I am at a loss regard Ruby's, ""What is special about the place that really move the meter?"" Ribs are back! But I do not smell wood smoke when I walk in so you kinda lose me here because I know in a chain what I am going to get, possibly ok ribs but not the type of ""oh wow Ribs"" that you might get at that wood smoker Rib-house down the street. The parking lot sets the tone, the front entry and btw ""What is that smell in the entry way?"" Fix that asap or..well you know.  That whole first impressions thing...wow that was just wrong. That did not say delicious food ahead. What we discovered was we were wrong for not heeding this lil warning. No attention at the front and waitresses looked at us but did nothing. Great why make us wait that long when the place was so empty on a Friday night prime dinner time. The service was not great but it was not the servers fault (We tipped strong because we feel her pain) but then the wait time for an empty restaurant seemed a bit long but not end of the world long. The food however was a massive disappointment.  I am in the wrong here too because I feel like if I am spending near $60 for a quick bite it should at least be pleasant and satisfying. This was neither of those. What I did wrong to was tried to reduce the stress of an already  uncomfortable experience by telling the ""Manager?"" that everything was OK when it was not. I felt like I was being robbed that I had to pay for food that was not as good as an average person would expect quality wise, or flavor wise, for these prices. My error there I will own that one, the other one was selecting this place because it had less of a crowd which meant hey faster service and I am hungry, lets go! But not so much.  One thing I would suggest to Rubys as a chain research the seating and comfort needs of today and change, change is good. The seating is uncomfortable and I get that may be a wise choice if you are trying to speed up table turnover, this place needs to do anything it can to be remotely appealing. Our meal was so bland and forgettable I question where the wheels went off the tracks but they need to rethink, well, everything. Seasonings would be a plus. I am at a loss how this store is open. If I owned it I would close it and start over. This needs so much it will take big money time and a team of sincerely commited experts to focus on the entire concept of community involvement, promotion, building, planning, execution, hiring, training, and everything required to get a winning recipe. They need to call Robert Irvine from the Food TV Network to revamp everything or something. The place needs something more than just a signature salad to win as a restaurant. If the kitchen is not producing food of a high enough quality as prices are out of control people will not step up and open our wallets for mediocrity.  The next time I set foot in one the Ruby Tuesdays they will need to have made some big changes. Nothing personal more of a ""To my standards"" Issue. Prove me wrong you guys I want to see you do well I am rooting for you, but you have a mountain of challenge to overcome. I will be watching to see you make me eat my words by doing all the right things, however I will be watching from afar.

3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,2022-06-18,1,,"Have been going here for years on a very, very occasional basis and it never totally sucked. It had always been a mediocre experience in food quality and service, but it was convenient...this recent visit will most definitely be my last. First thing I noticed was the sticky table...then the sticky menus...then the sticky salt and pepper shakers...onto the ketchup bottle and beyond. Yuk. Against my better judgement, I ordered coffee. Big mistake. It was coffee, I guess, but litereally tasteless. Then I ordered chicken tenders and CRISPY fries. If I order fries, I specifically order them well done because they are normally underdone no matter where you go and browning them negates some of the greasiness. Obviously, the waitress (yes, I use gender specific labels...sue me. I was a waitress for years and never took offense at being referred to as such) misunderstood my request and brought out a plate of rock-hard chicken tender-looking things with dried out, stringy white meat inside and a pile of underdone, whitish, mealy fries. Even the GMO corn syrup-laden pseudo-ketchup didn't help. The waitress was polite enough, but obviously over worked as she was serving at tables and behind the bar, then apparently forgot I was there and I had to stand up and leave the table to get her attention. All I wanted to do was pay and get out of there. The ""hostess"" intervened and asked what I wanted. I said all I want is the check and to leave. She took that as an insult and accused me of yelling at her. Seriously, I did not yell at her. She obviously was having a bad day. I pointed out that I was aware they are understaffed, as is every restaurant in the country...still, not my fault. $15 to $20 for a plate of ...whatever...I expect a little better quality and service.  That said, not a nice experience and not a clean environment.",https://www.yelp.com?hrid=3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,en,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/G2fwnmgyWpGmkFu5NuRF5A/60s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=WBlNyO07-1wjBbh0rMwzYA,Susan T.,"Matamoras, PA",9,1,0,0,"We are very disappointed to learn we did not provide you with a good experience at all.

Skimpy and that's just ridiculous! My friend ordered a glass of wine. She received before meal but it was bad so she went to the bartender and asked for a new glass.

They were not busy at all surprisingly.  When we asked if we could have a table for two the person seating us said ""yeah"".  She then walks us to a dirty table (mind you there were tons of clean tables) that has one chair.  She says ""hold on while I get you a chair, oh and I'll have to wipe the table.""   We asked if we could just have one of the clean tables.  She seemed surprised but she did let of have a booth.  Mind you my girlfriend has to walk with a cane after a knee operation.  We finally get seated and the waitress passes us by about 7 times before coming to our table and asking if we were ready to order.  We were not offered drinks.  We order our food and drinks at the same time.  The waitress then says she will get our drinks right away.  She walks off.  About 10 minutes later, still no drinks.  So I walk over to where she is.  She is sitting at the table counting her tips.  I agin request our drinks.  She finally brings them over and starts talking about how they are short staffed. (Isn't everyone these days?)   I am not sure how that applies to her forgetting our drinks.  So now she goes on and talks about how she is a school teacher that lost her job during the pandemic but has worked at the restaurant for a while.   She goes on about all of the lazy kids they are hiring.  She then said her daughter works there but isn't one of the lazy ones. We finally get our food.  The food was actually very good and it is the only reason I didn't give one star.  While we were eating, and elderly couple near us requested that the blinds be closed because the sun was shining right in.  They close the blinds.  The waitress (same as ours) comes back and starts telling the lady that they had to argue with a customer sitting near the window who wanted to look out.  Why on Earth would you come back and tell the lady that?  Handle that stuff in-house.  Now the lady feels bad. So after about 30 minutes, we finally get refills and the check dropped off.  No offer for dessert just the check in the table. It takes her about 15 -20 minutes to bring the cash out machine over.  She only did so because I held my card out in front of her as she was walking by.  She had spent that 15-20 minutes gabbing away at a table.  As for the interior of the restaurant.  The salad bar (which we did not have) looked old and not very fresh.

The quality of the cut was not too good and I doubt it was a 12 oz. I have had better prime ribs for less. I waited to tell the waitress but she never returned to check on us. So I ate it as cooked. One son had NEW fish and chips. We all agreed the 3 small strips he received looked more like fish sticks or chicken tenders. For $13.99 it was a disappointment. My other sons choice was the smokehouse burger for $12.99. This was the best value for the money, except he had onion rings instead of fries, and received 5 rings so if youre hungry opt for fries.

I have a life threatening bamboo allergy, whenever I order anything I specifically ask to make sure there's no bamboo sticks in or around my food. Usually there's never a problem. Tonight we waited almost 45 minutes for our meal, when it came out I could see a hole in the bun from the stick! When the waiter came back I told him that there was a stick in this sandwich at some point. He said yes I had it made 4 times and they kept putting sticks in it. Hello they served it anyway... He took it away and said he would let the manager know, and that dessert would be on the house. Approximately 25 minutes later a manager who did not introduce himself apologized and said he made it himself and he could guarantee that there was no bamboo stick in it and that my meal would be taken off the check. At this point my husband was already done with his meal and it's now 8:45 and I'm just eating my supper. I haven't even mentioned that I'm a diabetic! So yes we have free dessert and my meal was taken off. My question is why do they continue to use sticks in food? If I was that manager I would have completely paid the bill.

AMW-fUJm6YqBry4QCljx9A,2008-03-28,3,,"To me, Ruby Tuesday's has always been in a very boring category of theme restaurants along with Applebee's and, I don't know, Chili's? The last time i was in one was years ago, and it was probably this very one, years ago, and it was boring as shit.I went to eat at this location again with my mother, and when we went inside, we were shocked to discover that they had done a kind of huge renovation of the interior. Everything was dark and kind of oaky now. There was a little style on display. Everything was classed up with fancified nature art on the walls and this mystical art deco style in overabundance. Some of the art on the walls falls out of the nature schema and I could've sworn I saw a painting by Santiago Martinez Delgado hanging in there. It was... bizarre.So, along with the upgrade in class, so followed the menu prices. I ordered the gourmet chicken pot pie (not as stupid as it sounds, trust me), which came with organic tomatoes and little cluster bombs of mozzarella that were beyond delicious, and took a spin on the fancy ultra upscale salad bar (not as hokey as it sounds). It was delicious. My salad was amazing, not just with the selections of ingredients, but the quality of said ingredients, so I barely nibbled at my very tasty chicken pot pie and had to get a doggy bag. To a man, there's nothing that will emasculate you more than having to ask for the to go box. In fact, I said, ""I'm sorry, miss, but may I please have a to go box,"" and the kind and lovely waitress and giggled and said, ""You mean a doggy bag? Of course you can."" Awesome.All of that said, from the outside, this Ruby Tuesday's looks bigger than it is and looks just like another theme restaurant.  You wouldn't think much of it as you pass it by, as I imagine most people do each day. Inside, it's like a portal to another, much classier establishment, or some kind of Great Gatsby faux upscale joint. The light level is low, almost moody. I couldn't say that I wouldn't come here again, because I would, I just don't know how passionate I would be about the idea.

We were taken back to our table after about 25 minutes. Upon being sat we ordered our drinks and our waitress left us. Immediately to our right we're three tables covered in empty cups, plates, and kids menus with crayons. Our waitress came back to take our order and only after that did someone finally get around to cleaning off those tables.... 26 minutes after we were seated. I don't know how long they were like that before we had got there, but it's a holiday during supper rush you would think they would be eager to clean those off to seat more people. My father ordered the sirloin (medium rare) with shrimp. And my mother and i ordered our own food. After another 30 minute wait our food arrived.

On the phone, I asked for 11:00 a.m., and the man said there weren't any times left except beginning at 12:30, so I made reservations for 12 people.  A day before Thanksgiving, I called Ruby Tuesday to confirm our reservation.  We arrived at 12:25 on Thanksgiving only to find out that we would have to wait for an hour before being seated.  The young lady who was at the desk said that people without reservations were also being seated.  While we stood in line, waiting, other people who had reservations were also waiting. The entry was so full, you could barely walk through.  Some told us they had waited for nearly an hour.  I talked to the manager, but she was not helpful at all.  She blamed the people at the front desk and said that the walk-ins got out of hand.  She did nothing to help us.  When we were finally told that we could be seated (40 minutes later), we found out that the staff had put our family of 12 at 3 different tables.  What could have been an enjoyable day turned out to be a fiasco.  I watched as many folks with reservations left to find another place in which to eat.

CJX1FNYHsHLL4jwc_vvsnQ,2021-10-09,3,,"The food was amazing.  We started with the shrimp fondue appetizer.  I had half rack of ribs with tots and broccoli.  The ribs were done to perfection in their classic bbq sauce.  Falling off the bone and delicious.  My daughter had the shrimp scampi in a lemon sauce.   She too really enjoyed her meal.  She said the shrimp were amazing but the sauce was a little too lemony.  Overall, she would order it again because it had a lot of flavor.The waiter was subpar.  He was quick to take our order, but he never approached our table again except to see if we wanted dessert.  Never asked I'd everything was ok.  Never asked if we needed refills.  Not even a check in.  If he was overwhelmed by his 4 tables he was serving, fine,  but they were in a row (all booths) so he could easily have checked in while walking by.  Nope. Not the case.  It's a shame because this place deserves 5 stars based on our meal.  When it was time to pay, he brought over a portable credit card machine and left it on the table and walked away.  I wanted to pay cash but didn't because I wasn't sure if I was allowed.  I accidentally hit the wrong button on the machine and had to navigate my way through his other open orders to find mine.  Oddly, we had the same tab total as another table so if I didnt check it out, their bill would have been paid.  It's a bad system that allowed me to see other orders, but even worse that he just left the machine for me to do whatever with it.  Really I have one pet peeve when eating at a restaurant and this is when the server doesn't ask us if everything is OK while we are still eating.

It was made totally wrong, with tomatoes inside, no bacon or scallions inside, and not served with the pico and sour cream.

The waitress was great and took it off the bill but did inform me even they said when she took it back it was messed up. My daughters sliders, the cheese wasn't melted but were other wise okay and speaking of non melted cheese, check out the ""cheese fries"" also sans scallions covered in what appears to be canned cheese sauce (which tasted gritty like it was old and separating) non melted shredded cheddar and bacon crumbles. No ranch served like in the menu. (Also arrived when my mom was finishing up her entree) The fries in the kids meals were so bad my two year old was like ""nope"" and he eats old McDonald's off the van floor. My mom got the chicken Alfredo, the broccoli was hard and it looked and tasted like it had been microwaved from frozen.  She ate it though because she was starving.

Perhaps it's just this specific location, but I have given it two tries in two months and both times were awful.The first time I went I was told that there was a buy one get one free special between 3-5pm M-T. I was with a friend so we both decided to get the Steak and Lobster dinner. I didn't think it was possible to ruin lobster, but it was served cold and half hanging out of the tail. The steak was equally as bad. Both my friend and I agreed it was the worst steak AND lobster we had ever had.Then today I tried it again. Upon entering I was once again told ""buy one get one free"" by our waitress. Not wanting to try my luck with the lobster or steak again, we both got burgers. They were served at room temperature and were clearly not ""hand made 100% beef"".When we got our ticket it was for $30~ and didn't have the half off (buy one get one free, remember). Our waitress then informed us that it didn't count with burgers, but didn't bother to tell us that when we ordered... 5 seconds after she told us everything was buy one get one.All in all this is seriously the *worst* restaurant I have ever been to in Springfield... and that's saying a lot.

My husband and I decided to use our Ruby Tuesday gift card.  The restaurant was not busy when we arrived a little past noon.  We were seated right away, but it took awhile for the waiter assigned to our booth to take our drink order (water and iced tea).  Then it took even longer to get the drinks.Regarding our food, my husband's meal was fine.  However, the Cole slaw and honey mustard was missing from my chicken tenders meal, which was to be included.  The waiter realized I was missing the items and said he would get them for me, but he never returned.  I waited and waited, but  finally ended up having to go to the salad bar to get the honey mustard dressing.  I also had to get my own set of silverware from the table behind me, as I didn't have any, and had to get the ketchup and extra napkins from the cleaning station located near our booth.The waiter never returned to our table to see if everything was okay or if we needed refills on our drinks.  I finally had to go to the hostess to ask for another glass of water and iced tea.  Last, but not least, I found a hair on my plate that was not visible until the end of my meal (the French fries had covered it).The waiter never returned to give us our bill so we had to track down the hostess to see if she could take our payment for the meal.  Our waiter finally appeared and decided to take care of our payment at that point.  You guessed correctly, we did not leave a tip due to the poor service we received.Needless to say it will be awhile before we go back to that particular Ruby Tuesday.  :-(",https://www.yelp.com?hrid=AncpvA9shRgGVruwmr1pdg,en,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=NuDdo7OJwpdVczxscu8H1g,Jocelyn S.,"MD, MD",1,0,0,0,"Jocelyn, we are disappointed to hear about your experience.

i9cwVIs12zvXkqmps9p3pQ,2020-05-01,1,,"I was looking for a carry out burger the afternoon on April 23. At approximately 4:00 I found a website that I thought was Ruby Tuesday on Guilford Rd in Frederick Md. it was the right Ruby Tuesday but it turned out that the website was a company called Postmate. I ordered the food with no problem and paid with a credit card. I immediately got a text on my phone that the food would be ready in 20 minutes. 20 minutes later I arrived at the restaurant and had to call to announce my arrival. I was told that someone would come out to the car(Coronavirus). A young lady came out to the car with a bill. I told her I had already paid and she went back in to check. She came back out and said I hadn't and I then showed her my internet receipt. She said ""Oh, Postmate"". She went back inside and returned with my burger. I tipped her and drove to the other side of the parking lot. I opened the container and opened my cold bacon cheeseburger. I immediately drove back to the restaurant and called. The young lady came back out and I requested hot food. She went back inside and returned in a couple minutes with the same food.  She told me that the manager said that I would have to deal with Postmate with any problems. I said I just wanted hot food, not a refund. She said that was the manager's answer. I left with the cold food and called the manager the next day when I wasn't too angry To speak civilly and was told that when you order through a third party the third party is responsible. I emailed Ruby Tuesday corporate and have not heard back. Postmate also is not returning emails and does not list a phone number.

rD5py2egTnLxoZgEDglavA,2007-10-22,4,,"So my family and I were shopping out at the Ellenton Prime Outlet yesterday and we usually dine at Ruby Tuesdays afterward. We come to find that Ruby Tuesdays has been TRANSFORMED from just a regular American place that has decent food, to pretty menus, comfortable booths, and new meals on the menu that taste great. The only downfall to this whole thing is that prices were forced to go up for this new renovation. It's OK though! You can order two mini-burgers with fries and a salad bar for only $8.99, and not feel so bad for splurging on the greasy food when you have all that healthy and yummy salad to eat. Word of advice: Stay away from the Avocado Ranch sauce.The waitress was very nice, the only complaint I have about her was that she didn't refill my drink once I finished it (which was roughly towards when we were paying the bill), though I argue that it is the MOST crucial moment of waiting to secure your tip by putting a finishing touch on someones experience anywhere.

Clearly they have fresh avocados since we ordered another appetizer, which was served with fresh diced avocados. The presentation of our entrees lacked effort. We concluded our meal by ordering two deserts. The Double Chocolate Cake, which came out fairly good and the New York Cheesecake that was a total disappointment. Not only was it still frozen at the center, but it also came out naked and berry-less. Not to mention we waited over twenty minutes for it.

My wife finally settled on a fish group that featured a crab cake, lobster, and sweet potato fries.  Her choice surprised me as she is a bit of a foodie when it comes to seafood and I did not believe Ruby Tuesday was up to her expectations and unfortunately was proved correct as her crab cake was heavily breaded and by her accounts tasteless.  The sweet potato fries had a more of an out of the bag and baked texture to them and also proved a disappointment. The drink, however, featuring pear vodka and an infusion of lavender tea was good and she had a second. My fish order featured tilapia, salmon, and shrimp all of which were indistinguishable from one another excepting the shrimp had tails.  I believe these entrees came from the chef inspired menu.

We went a few months ago with a b1g1f coupon and got a hassle from the waitress about it.  The place is usually crowded because there isn't another sit-down restaurant nearby.  I decided to give it one last try last week. I had received a coupon in my email for a free burger for my birthday.  I got there around 5:45 and the restaurant was pretty full.  I became worried because the plan was for me to get the burger and bring it back home.  I was sent to the bar to place my order- upon asking- I was told it would be 15 min, probably less to get it.  30 plus minutes later- it came out.  It was cold by the time I got home, which really made me believe it had been sitting for a while when they brought it to me.  The BBQ burger was overdone (I  had asked for medium) and the fries were a soggy &  tasteless mess.  Thank goodness I didn't pay for it (which is the only reason why this isn't a 1 star review).

a__A86SlaN1gP2omWSLMuQ,2022-07-12,2,,"While walking on the strip in Branson Missouri, the wife and I stopped for some food and drinks. Thought we would make this stop an early dinner before going to a show and seeing all of the cool tourist traps in the area. First things first. Yes, the waitress was new and I believe her inattentiveness was because she was new, so, I'll give her a break on that. Also, I saw most of the draft beers were out because cups covered the taps and since I spend a lot of time in bars, I know that that means. We were there at about 2 or 3 in the afternoon, so the restaurant had been open for a while before we arrived. We ordered the salad bar and the steak and rib combo. After I got the salad, I ordered a beer from one of the uncovered taps. Well, after about 30 minutes of waiting for the beer, the waitress finally realized that she hadn't got it for me yet. Well, the tap blew and it was empty. A woman, not the manager, but talked like one came to the table. Offered me a bottle of the beer and would ""adjust"" my tab to the new price. Then she said that the ribs were not done and would not be done for about another hour.  I told her I didn't want the bottle beer and I didn't want meal any longer.   She did us a ""favor"" by only charging us for the salads and soda (the only items we actually got in the hour we spent waiting.We walked to another restaurant in the area and had a great meal. My only advice if you want to eat at this place is to ask 8fntheir issues have been resolved and if they actually have the food you want. Other than that, not much else you can do.

Since we were traveling we thought we would try them.Server was good.

Then when the bill arrived, my chicken sandwich was not on special as the server had said and the bacon cheese burger was rang in as a double cheese at $7.

Ta3XVr_ZCAAlATUKoNr8nA,2009-10-04,4,,"I'm already a fan of Ruby Tuesdays, most for their amazing salad bar deal.  How often can you find an unlimited, all-you-can-eat salad bar along with a nice hearty soup or mini-burgers for less than $10?!  Those familiar with the fancy digs of the Times Square Ruby Tuesdays may find this one a bit different.  It has more of a casual dining feel to it, with some nice booths and tables spread throughout the restaurant.  The seats are comfortable and the place is pretty darn spotless.  It definitely feels comfortable, and the staff is attentive but not to the point where you feel that you're being rushed.I ordered my usual white bean chicken chili with the salad bar.  I haven't had this dish in a couple months, and the last time I had it was at another location.  I was really happy to taste the same warm, cumin infused flavor that I've tasted so many times before.  The beans and chicken were tender and the chili nice and satisfyingly thick.  The salad bar was fresh as always, with several of the items getting refreshed at least once during my time there.  I love how crunchy their greens are and the grapes are nice and plump (seedless and sweet, my favorite!).This location is in the epicenter of shopping mania in NJ.  On one side you have Ikea and Toys R Us, on the other is Jersey Gardens Mall and beyond that is Jersey Gardens Movie Theater, one of the biggest in the area.

Np84IBat--1QuwDGandesA,2019-10-10,2,,"What would be the greatest addition to a mediocre airport located in a less than mediocre state? If your answer was ""an even lesser than mediocre chain restaurant location"" then slide in my DMs and we can meet up for a crisp high five!!After a quick trip to NYC, my friend and I decided to grab an even quicker lunch before our flight took off from EWR. Little did we know that this lunch could not be quick enough. I ordered a quesadilla and spinach artichoke dip, while my friend ordered a cheeseburger and substituted his fries with onion rings. This is where our joke of a meal begins. First comes out the dip and upon first glance, my face is a red flag emoji. The barely room temperature dip looks as if the restaurant bought it from a grocery store, added some Parmesan on top, and microwaved for 20 seconds. Taste was ok at first but with each bite, I could more clearly envision my future trip to the toilet. Quesadilla was ok but the sour cream was cold??! Excuse meeeeee. Then my man's burger arrives and remember how I said earlier he asked for onion rings? Guess what he got instead. FRENCH FRIES AYY. This may have been a blessing in disguise because based on the quality of the rest of the meal, I'm not sure the cooks here were capable of making acceptable onion rings. Also, the burger had cold buns. Must be a New Jersey thing. If I had to rank our food items I'd have to say the fries were first, the tap water came in at a close second, and everything else was tied for last.

We had to ask for our rolls, had to remind him to bring refills, and once he poured iced tea into a half full glass of Coke.  Then he started saying bad things about himself, how he was a ""stupid idiot"", but I don't know, it just made me feel bad for him.The salad bar was excellent.  They charge a dollar more for it in the evenings and I did not see anything extra on it, so that is kind of a rip off.  For the entree, I got the steak/mushroom/pepper with sauce and it was quite good, and cooked as specified. Don't bother getting the blue cheese coleslaw though.   I saw them go to the salad bar and get coleslaw and mix it with blue cheese.  It is nothing special.Endless french fires--yeah right.  You had to keep asking for them, and unless you asked for more, you got the equivalent of one package of ketchup.  Who knew ketchup was worth its weight in gold?  At least, that is how they served it.The restaurant was clean.  They kept the salad bar clean.  The bathroom was clean.  It wasn't too noisy to carry on a conversation.

ZbARdmQ9f1EX8bch-VuDHw,2010-01-05,4,,"We were staying at the Homewood Suites right behind the restaurant so stopped by here for dinner.  We arrived around 8pm and were expecting to have to wait since it was a Saturday night but the place was nearly empty.  I thought to myself that it because it's the day after Christmas but I couldn't help wondering...Even though the place was only about a third full, they made us wait an hour to be seated... nah only kidding.  They seated us right away.  After the customary drinks order we decided on the food.  Rather then going the safe route with burgers and the likes, we decided to try some seafood.  We ordered the tilapia with shrimp, crab cakes and a shrimp with penne (not sure of the exact name).  By far the best dish was the pasta.  There were a ton of shrimp in it which were perfectly cooked with that nice bursting crunch when you bite into it, not that mushy, gummy texture.  The penne was al dente and not drowned in watery sauce.  I think it might have had white wine in it, or at tasted like it did which was really nice.As for the tilapia, we were expecting it to be boring and somewhat on the dry side.  Well it wasn't.  The fish was very juicy and flavorful.  Unfortunately, it was on a little on the spicy side.  The shrimp on top of it were also nicely cooked.  The crab cake was blah...  We also had a chicken entree which i didn't try and an appetizer sampler which were the run of the mill fried stuff.What I thought was going to be nightmare actually turned out pretty well.

When I was told I'd be put on hold I let them know I'd just been on hold for over 6 minutes, and asked if it was very busy as I didn't want to wait that long again.

QYbbTUhOLpx53UEXnJ5VSA,2019-05-08,1,,"Worst waitress ever.... saw her 3 times. Once after we sat down, 2nd time to bring out our dinner 3rd time to collect money. She only had maybe 3-4 tables. We typically eat at local restaurants but we felt like the Ruby Tuesday's garden bar. What a mistake that was.... She never asked how our food was. When asking for refills, she never brought them. The hostess was the best person working in that place and we felt like she did more. She was the one to finally bring our refills. Don't get me started on the food. We ordered the pick 3 where you get an appetizer, entree and dessert cause it seemed like a good deal. The shrimp and zucchini was clearly set then forgot as one side was charred and the other side not. The steak had no seasoning, I had to season it with table salt and pepper and that didn't do anything for the taste. Mozzarella sticks came with 4 but only enough marinara sauce for 1 and half and we couldn't ask for more because the waitress never came back until our entrees came out. We probably had a few bites before we decided that we just wanted to leave. We skipped on the dessert that it came with cause we were that unsatisfied with the food and most of all our waitress. I come from a hospitality background and my parents own restaurants of their own and an Inn, so I am a firm believer in tipping and tipping well, but I would have to say this is the first time that I have ever tipped under 20%; most people would have not tipped at all. If I could redo how I tipped, I would have just given it to the hostess.

Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,2021-11-17,1,,"Have you ever wanted to experience the feeling of eating out at such a nasty restaurant, you'll wish they gave you a z-pack with your check after the meal? If so, you should head on down to Ruby Tuesday's in Elyria!Stopped in here with my mom recently. The parking lot had more potholes than there are holes in your average slice of Swiss cheese. A sign we missed of the horrors awaiting us inside...Walking in, the front waiting area smelled strongly of ribs and barbecue sauce...to the point where it was nauseating. (How is that even possible?!) Once seated, I noticed the table next to us needed cleaning underneath. Looked like the patrons used Parmesan cheese as confetti. The smashed particles look...gross. The atmosphere is interesting. I'm not sure what direction they were going for. It was like the 80s, 90s, and 00s threw up in there--and not the more stylish parts. I totally forgot they made plastic table cloths with felt on the underside. Haven't seen one of those babies since 2003! Adding to the ambiance were unruly children and grown men loudly blowing their nose. (This happens anywhere.)The food was lackluster at best. My soup spoon was sticky on the underside, and I noticed after eating it that the crackers I was given were recycled from another patron...the wrapper had dried soup on them that was NOT mine. My mom ordered a steak dinner. The steak was puny and dry...and the baked potato tasted dirty and old. She did enjoy the salad bar. I didn't take advantage of it; it was too close to the entrance and therefore not appetizing to me.My mom also stated that there were no locks on the bathroom doors. She also witnessed an employee not washing their hands after using the restroom next to her. We didn't stay for dessert, and I didn't order a cocktail I had been eyeing. Based on our experience (as well as plenty of Facebook reviews stating the drinks totally sucked), we weren't missing out on anything there.After visiting this Ruby Tuesday's, it was immediately clear to me why so many of them in the Northeast Ohio area shuttered...and it's mind boggling to me how this one is still operating! I have never wanted to un-eat a meal so badly in my life. It was truly a God-given miracle that we didn't wind up with food poisoning! Not worth the money, avoid at all costs.

oF602fC4mZTYA9EgbgWl0Q,2021-07-26,1,,"VERY DISAPPOINTED! Used to come here regularly. Had been at least a year but I was craving a famous Ruby Tuesday salad bar tonight and came here for dinner with a couple friends. The parking lot had so many potholes I really didn't even feel safe parking there. Such a safety hazard! Someone could trip and including the elderly. Walking in I saw just how disorganized and unattractive the salad bar was with food scattered all about, contaminating surfaces, and other bowls of food. They were out of croutons (the best part of the salad bar). Luckily the server brought me a separate plate of them but why didn't they just stock the bar? No reason for the salad bar to look like this. The sliders I got with the salad bar were bland and didn't taste very fresh. The only good thing was the zucchini I got as my side which had always one of my favorite things about RT. Server didn't know anything about the drink specials or what was considered a martini. Didn't have broccoli salad or some of the other things I'm used to getting. Unfortunately, I don't see this location being open another 3 months and will most likely close like all the other locations if it doesn't change soon!",https://www.yelp.com?hrid=oF602fC4mZTYA9EgbgWl0Q,en,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/gMhOghaUwFHNkF9VXZEsMg/60s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=M5rJ0osYBY4lA4ZCAtCbog,Anthony S.,"Grafton, OH",114,2,0,0,null,null,null,null,rTcGzEHIvFCV9sXRgujkzA

Yblr1jwfqqNAoUoUkEuaDw,2011-01-15,4,,"Chain me up!Having recently been forced to go gluten-free, I've had to revisit the whole concept of eating at chain restaurants.  In turn, I've visited this Ruby Tuesday on a number of occasions.  THE UP-SIDE:  Super-friendly service, enough room to spread out, and lighting that is easy on the noggin.  With an excellent salad bar that stretches a good 15 feet, there is always a quality fallback plan for those eating healthy and/or having to go gluten/free.  For those not worried about gluten, the food is pretty damn good for a chain.THE DOWN-SIDE:  This place goes out of its way to note that they have a gluten-free menu - they don't.  What they have is a long, xeroxed list of things to avoid on their regular menu.  While this is definitely helpful, it would be far more helpful if they just had straight-out gluten-free offerings.  Trying to hold up their regular menu and go between it and the xeroxed list is annoying and far too much trouble.THE SUM-IT-UP:  While I do wish this place would offer true and distinct gluten-free offerings, the salad bar does help fill that void.

We're on a tour of American chain restaurants and neither of us had been to Ruby Tuesday before. We were very pleasantly surprised! I wasn't expecting the food to be that good, and keep in mind it is still a chain that probably gets a lot of frozen stuff from large food distributors, but it was a lovely meal overall! We started with the spinach artichoke dip, which was my least favorite item of the evening, kind of bland and obviously processed. We split a Smokehouse Burger topped with BBQ sauce and onion rings (pretty good) and this Asiago Bacon Chicken dish that was the real winner of the night. Our server, Ashley, was friendly and quick to refill drinks. The molten lava cake could have used a little more lava but flavor wasn't bad.

The place is easily visible from the road.  There is ample parking on site as well.  The outside of the place looks typical for all Ruby Tuesday locations I have seen.  My visit here was on January 1, 2021.Let's start with Covid-19 protocols.  Like most places, masks are required for entry and while not seated at your table.  Entry is also not permitted if you exhibit any symptoms related to Covid-19 as well.  There is hand sanitizer available as you come in.  Only select tables and booths are available to ensure proper social distancing.We got here around 12:15 pm that day for lunch.  We were immediately greeted and seated when we came in.  We went around the long way to our table to ensure social distancing.  Once seated, Quinn came to the table to introduce herself, give us menus to look over, and asked what we wanted to drink.  It had been a while since I had been to a Ruby Tuesday, so it took a little while to look through the menu.After looking over the menu and the inserts, my mom and I decided to go with the 2 for $22 deal.  For the starter, we went with the House Baked Soft Pretzels.  For the entrees, we both went with the Classic Cheeseburger.  We also added the Garden Salad bar as well.Once ordered, we were able to go to the Garden Salad Bar.  There are protocols in place here as well.  It is self-service, but gloves and a new plate are required each time you go there (they are provided there for you).  The salad bar is actually pretty big with lots of different options.  It turned out to be a really good beginning to lunch.  A little bit after eating the salad items, the soft pretzels came out.  The queso was a great dip to go along with it as well.After about 10 minutes, the burgers came out to the table.  The burgers were hot and the fries were as well.  The burgers were cooked to order and juicy too.  It was a really good meal overall for both of us.  We were definitely full by the time we left.Overall, this was a very good visit here.  Service was on point and the food was great.  I will definitely be coming back here in the future.  They also have an e-mail rewards program.

The issues we had is, the server would disapear for long times, and when we looked she was sitting at the bar talking in a huddle of other servers.

I'm a short--err, petite--person but even my legs were too long for the close proximity in this booth.  There were four of us and our feet were on top of each others'.  Ah well.  There's food and conversation to distract us.Our waitress took our food and drink orders at once and said the biscuits were in the oven so she'd bring them right to us when they're done.  No big deal--we all ordered the salad bar too.  The salad bar was well stocked but the plates were warm, probably straight out from being cleaned.  It just worried me that my salad would be wilted from the heat.  There was your typical iceberg lettuce, baby spinach, and some mixed greens.  At the other end, there was broccoli salad, pasta salad, potato salad.  Love the broccoli salad.The Hubs ordered a $5 Long Island Iced Tea and I think he got what he paid for.  I'm usually pretty sensitive to alcohol, but this drink tasted and looked like it was all sours mix.We were done with our salads when we noticed that people that were just seated behind us received freshly baked biscuits but our table sadly lacked them.  We brought this to her attention shortly after and she kindly brought the four of us two plates of biscuits.Three of us ordered sliders--I ordered the Ruby minis.  They were okay for what they are.  They're cooked well done; I'm not sure if you can request them to be cooked differently.  The slice of cheese covers less than half of the burger, but the pickle slice was crisp.  With as much meat as there is, each slider could use either a larger slice of cheese or maybe two pickle slices--or both!  The burger is rather dry otherwise.  ):  Our friend ordered the turkey sliders--those come with lettuce and tomato!  If you order the salad bar, though, you can just get lettuce and a tomato slice for your regular sliders.  ;DWe were definitely too stuffed for dessert.

Brown lettuce, dried up cucumbers, dry pasta salad, rubbery spinach and broccoli, squash salad was dry on top from sitting out so long. I tried to eat some of each thing and it all kept getting worse, so I asked to see the manager.  He was polite, and removed the $11.99 x2 for the salad bars off our bill.  The waitress came over with our revised bill and said ""I looked at the salad bar and everything looked fine to me."" When I started telling her everything I listed above she rudely interrupted me and said ""wait...I'm leaving"". And walked away.  If she didn't want to hear what I had actually experienced from the salad bar then why did she think it was ok to voice her inexperienced opinion?  She didn't eat any of it.  She had no idea how bad it is/was.  So I will not be returning because 1) they served old food and 2) rude wait staff named Autumn.

wJuErJvZJhxTpbl7bJLZHA,2011-09-06,4,,"Yeah Ruby's is a chain.  It was one of the original ""brass and fern"" restaurants, and I am thankful to see the brass and ferns have gone the way of the dinosaur.Item to disclose: I once worked for this chain.  In grad school, I made ends meet waiting tables Friday to Monday at Ruby's in Greenville, SC while taking and teaching classes at Clemson Monday to Thursday.  Waiting tables is back breaking work that makes you appreciate the value of teamwork and a hard day's work. Having worked at Ruby's for a couple of years, I would gladly dine at one.  But one thing I learned waiting tables: don't piss off your waitron.  He or she sees your food before you do.  I'll leave it at that.  It's been several years since I've been to a Ruby's.  This one on Delk is the closest to us but is still several miles away, but we are not often near by, and it's just easier to stay closer to home. However, we had to run by Team Ford to pick up the Wagon Queen Family Truckster after getting the airbag light fixed, so we were right in the area and opted to stop by.  Additionally, we happened to have a coupon as well!The decor has changed from the brass and ferns of years ago.  The place is open, airy, and decorated tastefully.  The bar is in the center of the restaurant, but you run into the salad bar upon entering.  Might not be the best spot for it, but I guess that's how they want to run it.  Although we didn't get the salad bar, it appeared to have plenty of items to choose from.The menu has changed as well.  Gone is one of my favorites: the teriyaki marinated sirloin. That item was a real pleaser!  The menu has a nice mix of fish, chicken, and steak, but I will admit that the steak choices seemed rather slim.  But there were plenty of fix items to choose from. I picked the Creole-seasoned tilapia with sautéed shrimp.  It was one of the best fish dishes I'd had in a long time!  My wife choose a chicken dish and was pleased but wished she'd gotten the fish.  You get your choice of two sides with a dinner entree, and the there are plenty of sides to choose from.  I got sugar snap peas and mashed 'taters.  The kids chose the mini-burgers and the chicken fingers, both of which came with ample fries. Refills arrived quickly, and they even refilled my younger son's chocolate milk at no extra charge.  Most places charge for each chocolate milk refill.  Maybe they normally do here, and we got off, but it was a nice perk either way.So yes, this is a chain, but I don't think you'll be disappointed if you attend.  We went on a week night, and it wasn't busy at all, but I cannot speak to what it's like on weekends.  It is a tad off the beaten path being on Delk Road, but at least it's convenient to East Cobb.",https://www.yelp.com?hrid=wJuErJvZJhxTpbl7bJLZHA,en,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/Hqfcp0G1-YCreAiXVCnPRQ/60s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=IpHnGpk1UXt3xdOVKFB7UQ,Bronson B.,"Marietta, GA",30,3,0,0,null,null,null,null,gqfz5vhMbYHQ6K5tahKOfw

One was on regular cable, the other was on the box, so while we were waiting in suspense to see what happened on one TV, on the other, we already knew the outcome.  Oh, well...So, we ordered.  I got a plain old chicken sandwich and boy was it plain.  Plain tasting, plain looking, and just a standard chicken sandwich.  The fries were supposed to be bottomless, I guess my bottom was pretty shallow.  I got water, no ice and was treated like it.

uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,2020-05-13,1,,"I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. On Mother's Day, I felt that I wanted to at least order my mother and I a steak since we couldn't do what we really want due to the Covid 19 outbreak. Now, before people say give them a break because of this, just know the similar restaurants in the same area are just known to be less than a pleasurable experience. I ordered online and my mother actually was picking it up to bring on the way to see me so that we may eat together. She called from up there to tell em the curb side was a no go because after 20 minutes of waiting no one came out so she went in. The manager was the one who dealt with my mother in saying that the order wasn't ready and didn't know when it would be. She also said the ticket number didn't matter because they were so overwhelmed and ""everyone ordered steak"". Not a good look. My mother handed her the phone because I called to see if everything was ok. The manager basically told me the same thing. If I hadn't paid ahead, of course I would have cancelled. I had my mother leave because I didn't want her having to do all that on Mother's Day. My husband went back up there and brought the order back almost two hours after it was supposed to be done. ( I gave them an hour because of Covid and it being Mothers Day). The steak was thrown together. There was no difference in the well and medium well done steaks and both were missing the salad. We did however get the baked potato but that was a no go because they decided to put bacon bits on it when that's not how we ordered it because guess what... you guessed it. I don't eat pork . This was ridiculous. I hope any other companies who decide to open back up during the pandemic is ready. This manager told me that they are open , but not fully staffed. They aren't fully open not ready to serve inside, curb side and to go like they say. Plus they had a line out of the door trying to figure out what happened to their online order and curbside orders. They may as well have opened their dining room up to full capacity because the way this was set up, there was literally no room for social distancing if that was their goal.

W8CturDedYevyTc67V-vGA,2012-03-11,1,,"Let me share with you my last two visits to Ruby Tuesdays'.  My first visit after a very long hiatus was about 2 weeks ago in Conyers, GA.  The food was okay for chain food however when we were served their muffins/biscuits or whatever they call them, our party of four were served a total of 4 muffins.  Now if you haven't been to a RT, a muffin is about the circumference of a quarter and about 1-1/2"" high at most.  Four mini muffins for 4 adults seem silly but I thought that perhaps they were running low.  I then began to think of how many I would receive if I was dining by myself.  If only one, would it be served under a cover and revealed to me in a flourish?  Or would I receive two or maybe even three.  After dinner, I went to the men's rooms and you can guess, my ""radar"" was turned ""on"" for muffins.  I saw only one couple whose dinner had not arrived yet and they had 5 muffins.  Hummmm.Last night I went to RT in Loganville, GA and again we were a party of 4.  Guess how many muffins, we were served.  Yep, FOUR.  So off, to the WC for an unnecessary visit but rather an opportunity to see what couples or individuals were being served.  You guessed it.  One couple had 5 and another had 4.

I have to say, both previous reviews had some valid points but I think they were very low for what it was.  I had the Grilled Salmon, mom had Chicken Tenders and Salad Bar, and my partner had the Chicken Fresco with the Salad Bar.  For me, the salmon was cooked close to perfection.  The mashed potatoes were a bit salty but not too much that it was not edible.  Mom and my partner seemed to enjoy their salads and their respective entrees.  I had a bite of the chicken and I liked it.  Mom said their chicken fingers were extremely good.  The service there was very good.  The South really has very courteous servers.  The server was very attentive with filling up our drinks.  I'm not sure if the food came somewhat on the slow side but I think I was just jealous of my companions.  They had their salad while I had to wait for my entree.  The previous reviews were a bit harsh.  If you really looked at their menu, they have more than just spicy or Cajun dishes.

The server was a 4 as she was trying her best.... but if this is how this place is managed...  will never go to another Ruby Tuesday's again.Went to Ruby Tuesday's across the street from our hotel.  Tried to go to a Mexican restaurant which is normal for us when out of town ---  but it was Cinco De Mayo so ---- all forget going to a Mexican restaurant unless you want to wait for an hour and ...  well...  never mind.The parking lot was nearly empty so thought a good choice.... WRONG!!!  Only two servers and one bartender.  Most of the tables were empty because no one was working.  Hostess was sweet, kind, and very nice!!  Told us it would be about a 25 minute wait so ...  we did.  Once we were seated we decided to share a few Mexican appetizers since Mexican food is one of our favorites and the salad bar looked less than appealing --- which was the original plan.   Ordered two appetizers -- one was the nachos and didn't want the bbq sauce (yes, on chicken nachos) so asked if we could get salsa.  The server was very accommodating...  We also ordered the bean and chicken quesadilla.  Food came up in about 20 min which was okay based on the fact that very few people were working.  The food was warm at best ---  the quesadilla was about a 6 and was pretty good --- light on fillings and seemed like a small portion --- but the best food we had!The nachos --- Well --- really, really not good!!  The chicken was not cool but seemed to come  out of the refrigerator..  The cheese was lumped like nacho cheese but lumpy and cool...   The salsa --- well, it was the warmest food on the plate but it wasn't salsa -- IT WAS MARINARA!!!Our server came by and I kindly let her know that the kitchen probably accidentally gave us marinara instead of salsa...  and she said ---- ""They said they are out of salsa and this was the closest thing they had..""  WHAT????    A side a marinara with our nachos and they thought we wouldn't notice it wasn't salsa???????????????????$30 later and we should have gone to Taco Bell for a much BETTER DINNER as this was the horrible!!!  Tipped our server for doing a great job as we were thankful she came to work.Ruby Tuesdays --- WOW --- Never so disappointed.

l57DFQwHSB2I8F_Q3YgxrQ,2021-04-10,2,,"I am beginning to think the franchise has a problem. The Ruby Tuesdays I used to visit in Rosslyn (since closed down) was pretty terrible in regards to service, availability, and choices. It was a few years since visiting any of their establishments, and was hoping it would be a nice experience, especially so close to where I live. I'll just say that it fell below my expectations, and even then, they weren't that high.It's understaffed (at least when I visited) which leads to an overworked waiter/waitress, which then leads to mistakes. My wife's order was incorrect, my burger came out thirty minutes ahead of her meal, and it took an additional 10 minutes to be given the ketchup I had asked for.I really dislike giving bad reviews, I try to look at the best in everything, but without saying a word to each other during the lunch due the awkward nature of the environment, the first thing my wife and I said to each other (as if it were rehearsed) is, ""We're not coming here again.""That quote should tell you enough about our experience.",https://www.yelp.com?hrid=l57DFQwHSB2I8F_Q3YgxrQ,en,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/U6CJlk0auL0uaIrg_eWc8g/60s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=DWc4RvZlzi4KqaT03ljqmg,Khaled H.,"Woodbridge, VA",50,1,0,0,null,null,null,null,5L7foUaLrHJ6lAtRG_0bGQ

j_SCimK6XrNuCbRubd8Gvg,2021-01-10,1,,Came in today with my family and from the very start i knew things would be bad. I can't give the waiters name because he never told us he just had on a buffalo bills face mask. Our problems started with the drinks that he kept messing up because he refused to write our order down. As we moved on to ordering our food he continued to get the order wrong as we placed it. I looked at my wife and told her be ready because our food is coming out wrong. Sure enough 1 hour later our food comes out and my burger is beyond under cooked. My wife's steak is so tuff that she couldn't even chew it. Our daughter's burger was overcooked she didnt even touch it. All the waiter said to us was we can order something new ?! Why do you can bring that order out wrong as well.

UUY2XUorUbtFySZfjHyzLQ,2008-05-14,2,,"After enduring TWO HOURS of traffic to meet my sister near our parents' place, I was starving. I had to pick up ingredients at the Harris Teeter on Hoadly Road (one of few places that carries Swiss chard to my knowledge) for my Swiss Chard and Goat Cheese Strudel I was making for a potluck today at work. We were planning on hitting up Z Pizza in the same shopping center, but we agreed that neither of us felt like pizza.Around the corner is a brand-new Ruby Tuesday's. My sister is not a fan of the chain, mainly because she's vegetarian and their veggie burger ""blows,"" but I love baby burgers and Cheeseburger in Paradise blows (you can quote me on that)--so she relented. We are seated within minutes and shortly thereafter place our orders.I ordered the minis and salad bar combo for $8.99, not bad. Two baby burgers and salad bar--the only things I love about RT's. My sister ordered the veggie burger (no mayo) and seriously, it was the ONLY vegetarian-friendly entree on the entire menu. In addition, only TWO of the appetizers are veggie-friendly. Boo on you Ruby!I am excited to tear up the salad bar, but my sister harshes on my mellow when I ask her ""Do you want me to grab you anything?"" and she replies ""No, I lived in New York, I know how bacteria-ridden those salad bars are."" Whatever that means. My appetite is stifled a bit.Halfway through my salad, our waiter, Dusty, comes up and says, ""Bad news. We're all out of veggie burgers."" My sister and I exchange glances. Awkward! I'm already eating, and my sister pretty much can't eat anything else. Dusty offers to give her a free salad bar, but given my sister's aversion to such installations, this doesn't fix the problem. What a fatal move--he should have known they were out of veggie burgers when we ordered. And they just opened. How is it that they are out? It's not like vegetarians are flocking to the place. He says ""I'll go ask the manager what I can do."" I run over the options with my sister. Spinach and artichoke dip? Queso? A side of mashed potatoes with a side of baked potato? (Their only non-potato veggie side is broccoli, oh and rice pilaf.) He returns and says ""Well she said you can order the Club House Salad without the chicken."" Genius. In the end she opts for the spinach and artichoke dip, which is actually pretty good. Very spinach-y. My baby burgers were standard--which is still awesome according to my tastebuds. The fries are over-salted and uber-starchy, but that's just as well so I don't eat them all. My sister also order a Ruby's tea, iced tea mixed with Pom Juice. That was tasty.The bill arrives. We were charged for drinks, even a refill of the Ruby's tea. The bill is $18, nearly half drink charges. Come on Dusty, if you ever wanna ascend to the ranks of the Occoquan Inn, you need to learn the basic rule of drink-comping when you fudge a meal! I normally tip 20%, but dusty got a mere $2--He's gotta learn somehow.",https://www.yelp.com?hrid=UUY2XUorUbtFySZfjHyzLQ,en,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/vOtn9_ZQyeVjKqukRUmyMg/60s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=zAF--quEXsxrIDceOAAAzA,Courtney R.,"Washington, DC",495,4,6,4,null,null,null,null,5L7foUaLrHJ6lAtRG_0bGQ

It is VERY noticeable near the bathrooms.Sad.I shared a delightful lunch here with a friend yesterday. The service was so-so. Our waitress was good with one exception. She never brought the extra napkins we requested.Our appetizer wings appeared a bit malnourished. Or maybe this place doesn't use the chicken-on-steroids wings I'm used to seeing at other restaurants...My lunch was a turkey burger (special order I guess because of the bacon and cheese I requested) with lettuce and tomato. The bun looked quite tasty (as if toasted in butter) but was a bit too thick and definitely too hard (top bun).The burger was moist and flavorful but I had to ditch most of the bun. The fries were about enough for a toddler but I didn't complain. Potatoes make me sleepy so it wouldn't have helped me to eat many more of those. The ketchup (or ""catsup"" for those who like that word better) was too sweet for me. Don't know why but I'll check our fridge to see if we're buying the low fructose/corn syrup kind.My friend said the rim of his plate didn't look too clean and he was not at all satisfied with the presentation of his shrimp and pasta.Indeed, it DID look like someone had kinda just plopped it in the bowl, sans garnish of any sort.

wU4gLSXBpXBDsQWag-MDuQ,2011-08-04,1,,"1 Star posted because in order to post my review I HAVE to give a star rating. Here we go!Corporate Please plan surprise visit to this establishment.  There is no excusing or explaining the conditions of this restaurant franchise---Food Quality = Poor, Presentations of restaurant =Bad, Dining experience = Poor.  Will not return for food, only b/c of exceptional customer service will I ever return here. I will continue to spread my review until this restaurant is brought up to par.  Blogging every site to voice my concerns.  Read my comment:I really felt bad about having to write this review, but when I saw the other comments it eased my mind to know it was not me alone who had a bad experience at the Ruby Tuesdays located in Largo, MD restaurant park.  The restaurant smells bad.. (Health Department Inspectors please visit this restaurant unless  you are on the take).  I ordered to go. Its a good thing I came in to pickup and checked my order.  I was surprised to see they combined the wet with the dry(tomatoes and French fries) in the same to go plate.  The steak was far less than what I expected and requested for my order(I requested a medium/well cooked 12oz sirloin) the steak was overcooked and dry.  The dessert  I ordered came without the fruit compote and tasted stale.  The food and quality was all WRONG for such an established franchise.  Someone needs to quality check the food before it leaves the kitchen.   On the upside, I would have to say that the To-Go waitress Marie was the best I could ask for in a customer/public service employee.  She was understanding, did not object or make excuses and ensured that I received all I asked for.  Marie made about 4-5 trips to the kitchen to assist in getting my order correct!  She is Da Bomb for customer service and should receive something for her exceptional work ethic and attitude in providing great service in the food industry. Management, please remove the carpet and replace with hardwood floors.  Please get some fresh paint and wall paper too. The booths and chairs could probably use some re-upholstering as well.  The restaurant really smells bad and if you hungry and enter could possibly chance loosing your appetite even sickened from the foul odor in and around the establishment.  I am sorry to see such a franchise lacking panache and finesse in this well-to-do PG neighborhood.  Hope to see some improvements.

Why not have them re make the burger so cheese could have been melted. Noticed that the table close to me the waiter kept forgetting their food orders and adding things they told them to leave off. Well this doesn't bit the apple. I ordered zucchini it was so greasy I could use it to fry chicken. I ordered ribs they were cooked to hard couldn't cut it with the knife. So I let waiter know he sent manager out she replaced both well when it came back out looked as if someone ate the meat off of the rib it was just bones. I just threw it in trash when I left.

X1kefsOQ1D9ZVHCqACxIgQ,2010-09-18,1,,"This place has got some bad food --not just this location, but all locations I've visited.  Steaks are obviously frozen and low grade, resulting in a grainy, tasteless product; steaks always overcooked; mashed potatoes are obviously prepackaged, loaded with salt and barely tasting of potato; onion rings are obviously frozen and the onion is flavorless; triple prime burger is cardboard-dry; chicken fingers are obviously frozen; broccoli is dry and bland; salad bar mixed greens are often near the point of rotting; many salad bar vegetables obviously precut and prepared; salad bar salads (e.g. pasta salads) obviously made at some central factory and come straight out of a box...So what is so ""fresh"" about Ruby Tuesday's food?  They harp on this term more than any other chain restaurant, but fall flat on their face when it comes to delivery.This is what you get when bean counters, not people who genuinely care about the food that they're serving you, determine the quality of your food, folks.  It's not about the food; it's how cheap can we make it and how much can we leach out of the customer.  Food corporations are evil.The only 'bright' spot about this Ruby Tuesday is their bartender Justin: he's very cordial, always remembers my name and my friends' names and gets my drinks to me quickly.So why would I frequent a place that I detest so much?  Well, there aren't a whole lot of non-chain choices here in Florence, SC, so I am occasionally relegated to visiting Ruby Tuesday. People aren't very demanding here; they just take what they get, hence the success of more and more chains.  Also this location is only a mile down the road and it's the only place in my neck of the woods where I can get food and a beer.  What's the point to going to the next closest place that meets these criteria, Applebee's, when they're just as bad?  The atmosphere around the bar area isn't all too bad, albeit standard, which is where I generally hang out.  It's your run-of-the-mill restaurant bar with a couple of TVs.  I've sat in the dining area, and it's dreary except for the oppressively huge and bright lamp right above your booth.  Plus the service has always been very bad and slow.Bottom line: Having the audacity to serve to the food that they serve is what earns not only this location, but the entire company, one star.",https://www.yelp.com?hrid=X1kefsOQ1D9ZVHCqACxIgQ,en,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/qFNfo2UE59xRSfWu7Ewljg/60s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_ImB4GtZ0Jy7_lLJG1uI3Q,Dave G.,"Florence, SC",4,1,1,0,null,null,null,null,48Oi2ABCRQVVub8V3Rdj6w

KJp35T88DdknpZRq9uYYmg,2014-09-07,3,,"Update!! Down to 3 Stars :/ really would have liked to have given it 2 1/2. Ya know 50/50! The kitchen food is still really good sometimes, I will say that. It is hit or miss though. Everyone runs around like chickens with their heads cut off (servers & manager) when the place isn't even busy. Like at all lol. It was kind of funny to watch last time I ate there. Service is usually great though. Lol. A couple of the girls in there are very very good servers & should go elsewhere. Honestly. The salad bar used to be award winning at this location, but it's anything but a winner now. I kind of understand buffets (ew) skimping on the cheese & going for that plastic won't even melt in the microwave completely artificial stuff, but not Ruby Tuesday's. They are famous for that salad bar, and aside from that the salad bar by itself isn't cheap. The cheese might be the same at all locations & if so shame on ALL OF YOU! Also, it's funny, the salad bar will have let's say 4 empty containers waiting to be refilled, and you see at least 2 ppl coming & going A LOT from the kitchen with salad bar refills & yet 2 of 4 of those containers never got refilled. How?! It's usually the crackers & other crunchy toppings, but still, why are they staying empty?! It's not a mile long salad bar, how hard is it to give the entire table & look over?! Not just the cold ingredients. I STILL recommend the New Orleans seafood if you like Tilapia. They hit the nail on the head every time on that one. There is still time to save yourselves RUBYS!! Lol! You haven't lost your grip yet! Fix the cheese, maybe have your hostesses retrained. They all have funky attitudes & the seating chart is not as efficient as it could be.

The service is always friendly and nice (not always the fastest, but with my travel experiences, I feel that it seems to be a trend), however the food is not good at all. I do feel that they recently revamped their menu (or at least it looks different), however the quality is still just airport food. I have given a few different options a try, and have always been disappointed. Recently I even just opted for sides (as none of the entrees were catching my eye, especially with how many calories they consisted of), and I went with the broccoli and potatoes as a side (as this would be my dinner), and the broccoli was absolutely nothing special. Seriously, it tasted like it was cooked a while ago and mushy. It did only cost me $3.99 instead of the $10+ for an entree that I would be disappointed with as well, but I would suggest that you go try somewhere further down the airport as they might have better food (I am tempted to make the walk down there in the future as I have tried so many times for food here, and I'm always unhappy).Again, the beer is always good, and service is usually pretty good as well.

My mother ordered a fancy burger medium well. When they came my friends was pink in the middle and my moms was rare. My friend sent hers back. She has been a cook for years and so I asked her what the plan was in a situation like this. She said you make them a new burger. After 10 minutes her burger came back on a very hot plate. We looked at each other and knew exactly what happened. The cook nuked it. And what proof do we have? Her bun was rock hard.

MG-FVsSWq3MG4HcljKd3gg,2014-06-16,1,,"How is this dump still in business???!!! Some friends and I went last night ONLY because it's the only place that serves booze in Sanford on a Sunday night. Honestly,  we should have just brown bagged it outside of a decent restaurant instead. First off, our waiter had a kind heart but being a waiter was not his forte. I had wanted to get the salad bar because I figured, ""How can a fresh salad bar be bad"", right?! But after I saw how dirty the place was, not to mention the smell (I'm pregnant by the way), I decided it wasn't worth the risk to my fetus of possibly eating lettuce that wasn't washed properly or prepared by dirty hands. I went for something deep fried instead. Can't go wrong with buffalo chicken tenders right? Wrong! The breading was all mushy, almost as if the oil they fried it in was not hot enough. Gross! Also, we asked what the queso dip was and the waiter explained that it was a blend of 3 cheeses with peppers in it. We thought 'okay' and ordered it. It ended up being cheese soup pretty much with spinach and pinmentos in it! The only 3 cheeses I could have guessed it was made of was generic velvetta, cheez-wiz and EZ cheese. Oh, and the chips were extremely stale. Thankfully, our waiter took the queso and chips off of our bill.The only good thing that I tasted was the Thai Phoon shrimp. They were crispy, spicy and good.

When I ate the pasta, it literally had no flavor. And it was $18. Why...I have no idea. The shrimp did not come on skewers, it just came into two plastic clamshell containers. Which that didn't matter to me. But there were 4 in each clamshell (2 separate ones for some reason)...I think it was like $6 for the 8 shrimp. The pasta just had no taste.

VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,2020-04-19,1,,"A little background first on this place. I saw this place on Grubhub which was listed as The Captain's Boil. I was wondering why it wasn't on Yelp until I tried to add the business and Ruby Tuesdays popped up. The same location as well as phone number, I decided to call the place to find out who they actually were. They then told me they were Ruby Tuesday but also cooked for the Captain's Boil. My order through GrubHub:I saw nothing but seafood on this page and decided to give them a go through GrubHub. I ordered crab legs for 2 and plus the crawfish. I was feenin for some seafood and thought I would give them a whirl. Baddest and most expensive experience I've ever had in my life!!Crablegs:The crab legs for one comes with 2 clusters and 5 legs on each from what I was told. So ordering for 2, I figured I had 4 clusters plus the corn and potatoes as well as the crawfish also with corn and potatoes. No dice!!I got ripped off bad on the crab legs. I had 2 clusters with the legs and they put in just the two bodies with no legs at all! I was so pissed!! Crawfish:As this is crawfish season, how in the world did I end up with the tiniest crawfish imaginable! There was not one decent size crawfish in my order at all, and I may have gotten only 10, and that's being generous. I probably got less than that. Captain Boils sauce:Are you kidding me?? Really?? This so called sauce was nothing more than messy at best. It didn't bring out anything to me particularly in the seafood at all, well for the little seafood I did have. That was a total waste!!Corn on the cob:That tasted pretty good. Nice sweet corn with somewhat of a little kick is always favorable to me. I did have 3 of those which I think I should have 4-5 because I had 2 orders of the crab legs and 1 crawfish which also comes with it. Again, ANOTHER EPIC FAIL!!Potatoes:That was a total joke as I was supposed to get 3 but they served them quartered up. I may have had 6 pieces of potatoes out of the whole thing!! Price:This whole total EPIC FAIL cost me $66.00 including the tip for my GrubHub driver.

Spinach not looking so fresh? Grab some mixed greens. I also like having the extra topping options. The grilled zucchini was nice, but a bit too oily. The mac-n-cheese was really heavy and would have been a better side with a lighter main. The burger had good flavor and the chicken was pretty tender. The Benedict was the biggest disappointment.

WCw54Zv3bljIS_miHGjbvQ,2012-05-02,2,,"Holy crap, even for a chain restaurant this was bad. I hadn't been to a ruby Tuesday's in years because I've never been a fan of their food and I was reminded why last night.First, the service was horrible. Took almost 10 minutes to bring me a drink. This was a sign.  We order and it's a little more than a half an hour until our food comes.  If a restaurant is busy, I'm more patient but when you're one of three tables (2 of which are already eating) I find this disturbing.  When the food comes, my husbands order is wrong, and we wait another 10 minutes for them to fix it.  I try these zucchini minis, that sounded sooooo good, they weren't. The zucchini ""patties"" we're so thin and they put so much other crap on the bun that you couldn't even taste zucchini.  I got a side of snap peas and they looked as if they sat under a heat lamp while they waited for the rest of the meal to be cooked.The server was bad, but it didn't help him that the kitchen was awful too.  We did get offered free dessert, but I wanted the four cupcakes instead of the two.  (I thought they were going to be smaller then they actually were, but 4 was the full price dessert $4.99, everyone else in our party got a full price dessert) well, they only brought me two.  Too be fair, there's was no way I could have eaten 2 more cupcakes, but that's what I ordered.We were out with my father in law for his birthday and he had picked this restaurant.  He did say that this was unusual, that he normally gets great food with great service. But he also said that he would never go back on a Sunday night.  I know I don't plan on returning.

Got seated pretty quickly, but ended up waiting a while for our food, especially considering the restaurant was essentially empty. I got the salad bar, and my friend got the crispy chicken sandwich with fries (which shouldn't have taken that long to cook). The interior was nicer than expected, definitely a nice ambiance for a date night. My friend said that the chicken came out piping hot, and she could tell it was freshly cooked. She said the chicken was beautifully crispy and had the perfect crunch on the outside. She said the fries were average and didn't thrill her. She's had better, but she's also had worse. I enjoyed the salad bar. They had gloves available to wear before touching the utensils for infection control. The ingredients appeared to be fresh and didn't seem to be sitting out for too long. It had salad ingredients, along with coleslaw (utterly disgusting), broccoli salad (delicious), and watermelon slices. The only proteins available were diced egg and a slimy diced ham, which was disappointing. There were a variety of dressings available. Prices on the menu appeared to be average. Overall, there wasn't anything spectacular that would draw me back again, but nothing adverse happened that would keep me from eating here again.

The server comes over and has a hand held devise which you put your card into, and they stand there holding it while you add the tip!! What a horrible, horrible system, even being a good tipper I was shocked that this is how they handled card transaction.  Knowing that Card tips are tracked, I usually tip cash, even when using a card. The server was visibly upset, and slammed our to go boxes on the table and walked away.

0NgeZMyfVVf9Sw8aGoyOBQ,2009-08-29,3,,"The key reason for going here is that it is a short walk from hotel row at the Denver airport.We walk in to order take out.  The hostess says we can order at the bar while we have a much-needed drink after a tiring day of tornado-born flight delays.  A bartender who clearly doesn't do well under pressure, looks at us, eyes our menus, and tells us gruffly that ""We have someone who can take your order for take out.""  When we clarify that we'd like to order drinks too, he grumbles ""Alright, be right with you,"" then turns away.  Six minutes go by, while he's moving about the bar frantically, but not getting things done very efficiently.  He's like one of those pedestrians who fake runs as if to get out of the middle of the road quickly, moving his arms all around, but really isn't moving fast at all.  And also he's scowling.  He finally comes back after 4-5 other customers had cleared out, checks our ID (thank you), then takes our order, just as pleasant as can be.  I think we just caught him at a busy moment, and he's apparently not a guy who does well with multitasking.  The rest of our time there was fine.  It's a sports bar, plain and simple.  Big screen TV's all over, the nearest one being about 2 feet away from us, so it was a little hard to watch.  Bad nouveau grunge music playing.  It's all part of it.  Drinks were standard, though they have a non-alcoholic strawberry drink that's very refreshing after flying on an airplane.  The ribs & salad we brought back to our room to eat were great.I'd go here again only if I needed to eat near the airport.  It's definitely a step up from Applebees.  Just don't mess with the bartender if he appears busy.*NOTE* There are other Yelp review for ""Ruby Tuesday's"" at this same location, however they don't show up on a search since that's not the exact name of the place.

Their salad bar has been my go to place, but have not been purchasing salads out since the pandemic started, can't wait to get back to it. Take out has been very very touchy, we always tip $1-$5 for takeout usually $3, but only a couple of times have we had Fabulous should be Expected Quality Service. Sometimes they put you on hold and never come back for curbside, a couple of times they put you on hold and someone comes and hangs up the phone, they miss putting lids on sauces etc in your takeout and it spills everywhere defeets the purpose of sauce of the side to dip or just try, they fully forget items in the order, they tell you that you Have to come in for curbside, it seems to be the culture there to work little, other times the meal is packaged up Perfectly with condiments and lids and everything!, it's just unpredictable, but what Should a National Chain be, it Should be Predictable, you should be able to expect the same Every Visit! They don't know here that I won a 50th Anniversary prize on Instagram from Ruby Tuesday, I should wear my attire there, huh, lol. And even the marinara cups on the Crispy Mozzarella Sticks are inconsistent, some know to use the larger dipping cup, others use the small and you run out of sauce after 3 sticks, half the time it's been right and half the time wrong. And the attitude that they give, putting you on hold and hanging up, etc. Some of their new 50th Anniversary menu is pretty good, if you can get it made as it is meant to be---nice Philly Cheesesteak and Crispy Mozzarella sticks, don't know why I tried the Coconut Shrimp though, I don't like Coconut, lol, a no to those for me, lol, it was fresh coconut though, too strong for me, lol! And crazy dried out baked potato, must have been from 2 nights back, straight to the trash! Other times the potatoes are Perfect! We've been there in the past for big church celebrations and sometimes just carryout for 1, but they don't see that a $3 carryout tip one day could come back as $100 small group sitdown tip.

I mean nice to the point that we all but forgotten about our frustrating night. I ordered all you can eat salad and the grilled salmon with rice and vegetables. While I don't go out of my way for run-of-the-mill American fare, I have to say my food absolutely hit the spot. The rice salmon and veggies went so well and was just what I needed.I had the chocolate lava cake for dessert but since I had been on a diet cutting out added sugar, it was too sweet for my taste.The star of the night however was our server. She was a young lady only on her third day. She was very nice and respectful and always asked us if we were okay or needed anything. Also, my friend who is also a waitress complimented her and was giving her some tips and she was very receptive to them.To summarize, while American chain is not on my radar, the food and especially the service, greatly improved our sour night.

There were still a decent number of patrons dining, so we thought it worth to ask if they would seat us even though they were kind of in wind down mode and we would obviously force them to keep the kitchen open longer.The hostess was very accommodating and sat us quickly at a few tables near each other.   The manager and waitstaff were friendly, and we had zero issues with ordering as they provided everyone with an individual check that we consolidated by family at the end, departing the restaurant around 12:45AM.There were no complaints about the food - I think everyone ordered something different, so it was good across the board.Service was slightly slow on the beverages and refills but forgivable due to our size.

I am glad that I did not hesitate because it truly pulled me back in to how much their dishes do not disappoint. Well some dishes! I cannot wait to go in person to see how delicious this is straight off of the grill. Even the bacon crumbles from the loaded baked potatoes were really really good.

WA8QNYypSeThsG3Sh7LX4A,2021-11-08,3,,"3.5 stars. Ruby Tuesday is a casual restaurant chain that sells appetizers such as spinach artichoke dip and chicken quesadilla, main entrees such as burgers and baby-back ribs, and a small selection of desserts and beverages. My husband and I ate inside this location of the restaurant one time for lunch. The seating hostess promptly seated my husband and me at a table. Soon our waiter arrived and took our orders. I noticed that they both wore their face masks around their chins. I did feel happy to see a container of hand sanitizer near the salad bar. The salad bar cost only $5 per person, and it included many ingredients to assemble a tasty salad as well as ready-made potato salad, macaroni salad, and some fruit. For our entrees, my fish and chips consisted of somewhat thin fish filets (my husband commented that they almost looked like fish sticks!) with tartar sauce and crispy French fries. My husband ate a chicken sandwich. He does not like to discuss his food, so he simply said that this sandwich and the accompanying French fries tasted ""fine."" His drink was raspberry tea, and it had an extremely raspberry flavor that he liked. The waiter did bring a drink refill. The waiter also bought out our bill promptly. The total price was $41 plus a tip. He thanked us and told us to have a wonderful day. A couple of hours later at home, my husband commented that his stomach felt a little upset, but he did not get seriously sick.",https://www.yelp.com?hrid=WA8QNYypSeThsG3Sh7LX4A,en,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/xMao8--bK--9ke5958tWrw/60s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=FW5F5QzzMoeRdIib1OyNOw,Tiffany Y.,"Pittsburgh, PA",1209,0,0,0,"We are very disappointed to hear about you and your husband&#39;s experience, Tiffany.

She always remembers us, what we like and how we like it.  She is always kind and friendly as well as quick and efficient at serving us.In my experience, it is hit or miss at many Ruby Tuesday's as to whether or not they will cook items, like their salmon, to order (i.e. medium) or not.  This one does which makes for a perfectly mouther-watering, buttery delicious piece of fish.We usually only order the salad bar and add grilled chicken and/or grilled salmon which they prepare very nicely (except with an occasion new cook, then it may require a re-order).What would make it a 4-5 star review for me? More grilled and healthy entrée and options that are scratch cooked with fresh spices and herds and not heavy starchy sauces.

I sat at the bar as I usually do and waited for about 5 minutes which is normal and I don't mind to be honest since there is only one bartender and no servers in that part of the restaurant. I wasn't greeted by the bartender, instead was looked at rather rudely and asked if I was picking up an order. I said no I am here to order and she just said, for here? Anyway, was given a menu, wasn't asked if I would like anything to drink so I asked for a yuengling, was told they didn't have it so asked for a corona. Was given the beer with no lime or a ""here you go"". Was it a little busy? Yea, was it my fault, nope. When I paid, no have a good night or anything. I have worked in the food and bar industry for my whole working career and cannot stand rude service. If I see you being cordial with other customers and not me for some odd reason, not sure what the deal is. I'll walk right out if that person is behind the bar when I go back. Now the food. I never expect something amazing since it's a chain restaurant but it's food. I've never really gotten anything I don't like. However, this time I knew the burger was a frozen Patty that you can get in bulk, you could just taste an odd flavor. There were two tiny pieces of onion on it and rotten lettuce. I understand that meat is expensive right now and the place may need to cut some corners by ordering prefrozen beef, but lettuce and onions tho??

The service was far beyond what I usually expect to get a chain restaurant, especially a Ruby Tuesday. Between the five of us that were there, we put down quite a few beverages and the server was spot on, we never had one empty glass. This was a Saturday night and it was packed so we were pleasantly surprised. The food came out quick, everything was just as we ordered and prepared correctly. All of it tasted great. The only gripe we have is with the portion size but that's not by fault of the particular establishment, it's just how things have been since Ruby Tuesday decided to attempt to reinvent itself.

Let's start with the fact that my friend and I both got food poisoning from the salad bar of which we are still medicating for. Let's also add the fact that we weren't seated for more than 5 minutes because NO ONE HERE WORKS. I'm sure the GM would be shocked to know the employees here stand around like a gaggle of geese gossiping and joking around instead of serving paying customers. The salad bar was lacking several items and I had to ask the server to refill eggs, croutons, corn, cranberries and several other things TWICE and it never happened. She didn't bother to check on us for anything until we were ready to go so she could get a fat tip and had the audacity to complain when I gave her 12% out of decency. She literally earned NOTHING but I was raised to tip at least 10% even if the service is terrible and the fact she loudly complained making a scene in the restaurant is an experience I have never had before.

The cheeseburger was, ugh, could've gotten a better one at BK, asked for everything on side, but of course it came with everything on it, my friends asked for no sour cream on dried-out potatoes and of course it came dripping and oozing with sour cream, we asked for very little ice in our drinks and the glass comes filled to the top (we ask the waitress for a glass and spoon to take out all of the ice, she watches us do this, yet NEVER offers to have the drinks remade)....and the only response we get from the waitress is, ""I told them too, I told them too.""

If you do brave the menu for an entree, a salad bar usually can be added for a buck.

jDEE-amP8AJ9H_LrAgl6gw,2022-07-29,1,,"Oh man, where to start. Ruby Tuesday used to be pretty good about a decade ago, but times have changed. The place was so under staffed they could only have maybe 10 tables out of 40 or so open at one time. There were two waitresses for the entire place, and I don't think there was anyone designated to bus the tables because empty tables stayed dirty the entire time we were there. I'm not sure who was washing dishes, but we ordered our water and they came in dirty cups. We asked for different glasses of water, because the grime on the inside of the cup wiped away with a finger swipe and I didn't want my kids drinking out of dirty cups. We get our new glasses of water and those cups were dirty as well. After asking for clean glasses our waitress didn't come back to our table for a while, which is fine as there were literally only two of them, but it did feel a little personal. We finally got to order our food, and my husband ordered the Triple Play Platter with ribs, shrimp, and chicken ($22 bucks)...the portions of this plate were...disappointing and definitely not worth 22 dollars. The rest of the food was mediocre. We did tip our waitress because regardless of my feelings towards the cleanliness and food portions, she did bust her tail and was friendly.

fRWWzn1Nb_1NDitBp40G0Q,2022-02-08,4,,I called prior to my arrival to inquire about the weight and was told about 20 minutes. I arrived ten minutes later to be told it's still 20 minutes but after a few was immediately sat in the bar area since there was no one sitting at the bar. The waiter was very cordial and he provided our initial drinks fairly quickly. He came back several times because it took us a little longer to order. Once the food was ordered we went and help yourself to the salad bar. They are usually known for their salad bar and for the most part it was pretty decent but there were several things that they were out of an obviously were in no rush to replace since I or entire trip they didn't replace things like the signature croutons among other things. What are food arrived we had one minor set back which I was able to get corrected. My big issue was constantly having to tell the waiter to fill a bar drinks even after bringing stuff to the table and seeing the cups completely empty. Yes that is a huge pet peeve for me to have to ask to have my drinks refilled since when they are in a completely observable area and are to the bottom empty it should be an expectation for them to be filled. Several times I had to find him and let him know we needed something to drink.

To start, the first worker we encountered ignored us as we walked in, walked past us multiple times without saying a word to us and left us waiting at the door to be seated for about 5 minutes in a mostly empty restaurant.

Against our better judgement, we ordered the salad bar with our food. It was under stocked, not fresh and what was had the tongs/spoons laying in the food, handle and all. They seemed understaffed and our young waitress was juggling multiple tables and greeting guests, it took a little time to get her attention for silverware. About 10 minutes after ordering, we heard the kitchen call order up. The middle aged waitress went to the kitchen, came out looking at us and then just stood there not taking out food to anyone. After quite a bit of time, our food was brought out cold, mushy and absolutely disgusting. The bbq nachos was topped with what looked like American cheese sliced that cooled into a plastic like texture. The chicken was puverized into a sauce that looked like vomit.

NdgfHIDRNCskZJRZLa6gDA,2013-06-23,1,,"As they say in radio-land....first time, long time.  My first ever Yelp review after years of ""lurking.""  Finally a place so bad I had to write a review.  9 of us dined at the Ruby Tuesday outside the Edinburg Outlet Mall last night.  We were there on a swim-meet weekend, competing at Franklin High School, about 20 minutes away.  We were seated after a slight delay and proceeded to place our orders, I played it safe getting the ""garden bar:"" and some ""Chef Inspired"" chicken wings.  My wife had the Louisiana Fried Shrimp, with Onion Rings along with the garden bar, while my youngest son went for the Quesadilla.  Unfortunately my oldest son and the competitive swimmer selected the Parmesan Chicken Pasta.  All of our dishes arrived without delay, which was nice because a few of the folks around the table ordered the Queso Dip with chips.  The Queso might have been the nastiest looking goo I have ever seen.  The Quesadilla and the Chicken Wings, while nothing to write home about were fine.  The Shrimp on my wife's plate looked like something straight out off the GFS truck and the Onion Rings probably were on the same dolly with the Shrimp when they were wheeled off the truck and into the freezer in the back of the restaurant.  All of this for $12.99.  PLEASE!!!After a few minutes of eating I look over at my oldest son and notice that he is picking at his food.  Now let me tell you, this kid is 16, a swimmer and a growing boy.  He eats!!!  Normally he does not pick at his food.  I look over at him and he says ""this chicken tastes funny,"" and he leaves the table to go to the restroom.  I follow him and when we get to the restroom, he feels like he is going to get sick.  He doesn't and I tell him to go back to the table, eat the pasta and leave the chicken alone.Too late, damage already done.  At exactly 108am, he awakes in the hotel room and immediately runs for the bathroom.  After a few seconds of heaving uncontrollably, he starts choking!!!  He has a food particle (from his own vomit) stuck in his throat.  He can't catch his breath!!!  Finally he does and proceeds to deposit his entire meal in the toilet at our hotel room.It is now 24 hours after this wonderful meal and we are treating him for full blown food poisoning.  His fever is 103 and he has been reduced to a shell of his former self. Do yourself and your family a favor and avoid this horrible place.  I understand that accidents can happen anywhere, but it is restaurants like this that give our American food supply a bad name!!!",https://www.yelp.com?hrid=NdgfHIDRNCskZJRZLa6gDA,en,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/K8Tsu_8Nq6dpV38MQ-WbNw/60s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=OpLecdbIzrXQUDSeVSV0xw,Monty A.,"New Albany, IN",1,0,0,0,null,null,null,null,_3vHVsPOdNqY6wudAHa6PA

The food was pretty average but I appreciated that they have several ""healthy"" options and many of their side items are a more healthy choice than french fries and include the calorie count (cauliflower mashed potatoes, fried zucchini, asparagus, etc.).  The salad bar has a decent amount of veggies, including soybeans, so that alone deserves a star.  It's only $2.99 to add the salad bar to your entree and I think that price is pretty fair seeing as it's unlimited.  Staff was friendly yet a bit slow, even after the lunch rush.  I found it kind of odd that it seemed like the place could use a good cleaning.  The floors were sticky, the salad bar was askew, and the front doors and windows were very dirty.

Two of the waiters took it down from the heat shelf.  Then I watched as these two used their finger tips to rearrange my food and then pick up a towel (RAG) that was on the prep table and proceed to wipe the edges to include the areas around the food with it.  After they liked the way it looked the placed the now dirty (dirtier) rag back on the table and turned around, walked over to me and set the plate down on the bar.Refused it on what I had just saw.  The manager came over and informed me this was ""normal"" practice there and fully within the food inspection/codes.  Also told me it was ""corporate policy"" to do this. The rag I had watched being used was not a rag but was a clean towel they used for this.  Manager was very indifferent and didn't care.Told him they could close me out.

We had burgers.  My wife's was as she ordered.  Mine was great, but only as a shoe sole!   Grossly overcooked.Why does this chain think they can operate without a trained manager?  Why do they think they need 4 or 5 high school kids milling around, where 2 trained people could the job.  I forgot to add how the restrooms could use attention, again, where's the manager.

QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,2020-09-27,1,,"The food isn't that great. I've been to one other Ruby Tuesday's in Harrisburg that I wasn't impressed with and this one followed suit. I had the cheddar broccoli soup and the broccoli was half raw. Needed cooked longer. I can handle al dente to a point but spare me crunchy vegetables in soup. Panera has them beat hands down with their broccoli cheddar  soup, too bad there isn't one nearby. The baked potato was ok but it takes a lot to screw up a baked potato. The salad bar was very basic without much fanfare. The smoked ham cut in little cubes was way too smokey tasting. Overall the food deserved two stars but there is no way to break the rating down.The service was five stars, again, no way to break it down.But in the end the place is only deserving of one star because you take your health into your own hands going inside. We're in the middle of a pandemic. Covid cases in Clearfield county continue to rise and so does the death toll. I realize this is DuBois Pennsylvania and the politics of the region play into the whole ""I have my rights"" dialog, and people do, but not when they interfere with my rights. Why have a sign on the door of the restaurant saying masks are required when you are seating people who come in without wearing masks? You don't even ask them to put one on. Add a sentence at the bottom off the sign that says ""NOTE: WE DO NOT ENFORCE THIS MASK RULE"" so that I can make an informed decision whether or not I want to expose myself to covid from people walking in past my table without wearing a mask. This is not an outdoor restaurant. I left before I could see if the people who were seated without masks went up to the salad bar not wearing them. I don't have to really guess if they did or didn't. So if you feel you're immune from covid and are put off by wearing a mask then here's a place for you altho frankly, even without the pandemic, the food alone wouldn't have me coming back. But most importantly, if you're not going to enforce the rule you state on the entrance door then you need to either take the mask sign down all together or include a statement that you're not enforcing the rule so people like me have the option of turning around and going back to their car.

Upon entering the salad bar looks like a buffet that wasn't cleaned up after a party... my booth  bench was dirty as was the window sill (like food particles & dirt!!) service was slow then when my drink came the cup was dirty. Lastly they were out of fries & onion rings and when asked if I could add sweet potato fries at no extra cost (since they were out of fries & onion rings ) Iwas told they would have to charge me extra anyways.

P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,2021-09-08,1,,"If I could give 0 stars, I would. First, the server did not speak or tell her name (still don't know her name but if I did, I would tell you). When we ordered anything and said thank you, she would not reply. Just rude for no reason. We placed our order, and she never came back. When she finally brought out the food, she didn't bring my sister's food and stated that they did not have the Alfredo for her pasta. So I was like why bring out half the food and not tell us earlier that her meal was unavailable? So, my sister re-ordered after I had to run her down. I, also, asked for a manager. No manager or re-ordered food ever came. Keep in mind that I'm not eating my food until my sister's comes. I finally asked another waiter for the manager, and when he did come, he said that it wasn't that they didn't have Alfredo but that the order was put in wrong. So the server lied. He also tried to defend her as if she was so busy but the restaurant was not busy at all!!! Instead of owning the mistakes made, even when we told him how she never came back to check on us or refill drinks. So by then my sister is mad and asked for our ticket for just the food we had. She didn't want the re-order, she just wanted to pay and leave because we were not out for free meals like he offered. I, myself, know the steps you take when you screw up on an order, since I had been a server for 8 years. They still sent out the re-ordered in a Togo box by the 2nd server and brought me a Togo as well since I didn't eat without my sister's food. Our server and  the manager never came back to our table to apologize or give us the check, so we left hungry minus the app we shared. I know this restaurant will not miss our money but they will NOT see it or our serve again!!!! I felt like we were treated with no respect, as if we had did something wrong.

Our past few experiences were not at this particular Tullahoma location so I am not condemning this establishment for what another did. With that being said, this one was probably the worst. We came in after my sons graduation ceremony. It was around 9:30pm when we strolled on in their doors. While we had noticed many other restaurants were packed full, this Ruby Tuesday's was no where close. (Hindsight is 20/20). We were quickly seated then told to wait to be seated because they had not yet wiped the table down. After it had been cleaned, we sat and looked over our menu. Our waitress got our drink orders and I asked if they seared their steaks-to which the waitress replied, ""I don't know, let me ask."" She came back and said no. We then proceeded to order: Chicken Broccoli Pasta, Chicken Mac N Cheese, Ribs with Broccoli and Zucchini, Shrimp and Sausage Pasta, and some Chicken and Bacon something or another... 2 adults, 3 children- So, my husband and 1st daughter received their plates first. Afterwards, we received the cheese sticks my other daughter ordered as her appetizer, my son received his order second, mine third... yep. Nothing came out for my other daughter. The waitress said she was going to check on my second daughters food and would have it out directly...Meanwhile, everyone is tasting their food...no one liked their food except for my son.

After waiting for them to find a space large enough for our group and move tables together, we sat down.  The waitress was horrendous.  For a group our size, we should have had our own designated waitress.  She brought out drinks, never brought straws.  Brought out biscuits, never brought appetizer plates; guess we were susposed to put our biscuits on the reusable table cloth?  Food took absolutely forever to come out, glasses were completely empty and the waitress never bothered to ask refills.  When the food finally did arrive, every hamburger was extremely undercooked.Waitress never came back to ask how the food was, refills, coffee, etc until she had the check in her hand.

Regardless, we were seated promptly by a server, Whitney, who took care of us.  She was so nice and although we each opted for the mini sliders with the salad bar, she kept the drinks coming and cleared plates as quickly as possible.There definitely is a draw to the salad bar and if you think about it, you can certainly make a fresh meal as healthy as you want.  That definitely was a plus and it was clean and well-stocked.To sum it up, the service was nice and efficient.  The food was good, but nothing spectacular and the area was inviting.

Generally, we have been pleased with our past experiences at the Ruby Tuesdays we've dined at (including some that have closed.)This month, on a pleasant evening, we decided to make a special trip to this Wrentham location for dinner, arriving a little before 7:00. THEY WERE CLOSED! We had used the iPhone Maps app, which posts their closing time as 9:00. Then I checked Google, which also lists their closing time as 9:00. Then I checked Yelp, which has the closing time as 10:00!!Ruby Tuesday itself has posted on Yelp. They know about their listing there!Three major sites that people rely upon for hours of operation are all wrong! If only one was wrong, that would be bad enough, but ALL THREE are off by several hours! And CONTINUE to be!With gas at $5/gallon, we wasted money and time. And our evening plans were ruined.A word to the wise: DON'T GO TO THIS RUBY TUESDAY FOR DINNER. You can't rely upon their posted hours.If a zero-star rating was possible, that's what we would give this Ruby Tuesday experience.  By definition, food doesn't get worse than NO food, and service doesn't get worse than NO serviceHopefully, all the hours of operations will be corrected soon, so others won't have the same aggravating experience.

Our food came out at different times and my food by the time it came out everyone was done eating (and I ordered the same food as 2 people at my table). Other people who arrived after us got our food before us. The manager gave us a discount and apologized which was appreciated. Our waitress avoided us and didn't give us an explanation as to why the food was delayed. It felt like as soon as she knew we were getting irritated she stopped trying because she barely came to our table. As a result of her poor communication (the food late isn't her fault) it affected her tip. I've worked in food for 10+ years. You need to inform the customer and help them understand. Turns out a bunch of late orders came in as soon as we sat down - that's why the food was late. So the waitress definitely should have informed us. She was young so maybe it was her first time...?

The salad bar is a meal in itself, always with lots of choices and fresh ingredients. I did notice this visit that the salad bar was missing both croutons and bacon bits, two of my favorite ingredients to a salad, so I was a bit disappointed but there were still plenty of other delicious ingredients to add to my salad so I was still pretty satisfied with the salad bar. On my last two visits I have noticed items missing from the salad bar but I am wondering if the reason may be that because the restaurant closes rather early on Sundays (we usually get there around 4 PM and they close down at 6 PM) they might not replenish things that run out on the salad bar around that time of the day. But of course that is just a theory. We both enjoyed our meals and the salad bar as an add-on really hit the spot.I noticed this time they have a new menu and they added some new items and took away others such as the hamburger sliders/salad bar combo which I used to order quite often (I hate to see that option go).

Then I asked to see the manager and was told he was very busy helping in the kitchen as they were short staffed today.  I think that is the answer to my poor serving.  Also, since no one was actively supervising the staff, they felt free to wander around without their masks on.This was the worst experience I have had in a restaurant in years.

My daughter and I started to eat.  My mother started to eat but only had the steak to start with. When the waitress finally came by explained about the baked potato and asked for fries instead. After a long time, the waitress came back and said she had to take the baked potato back. Finally, after my daughter and I had finished eating, my mother's fries came.  She had eaten her steak by itself.  No one from management came to express apologies.  I asked the waitress to not charge my mom for her meal since part of it arrived after we were finished.  Then finally management came to our table.  I could tell by how her face looked, by what she said and how she said it, that she was irritated.  She said that the only thing she would do is not charge the 3 drinks.  When the bill came we discovered we had been charged almost $7 for the one dessert that was part of the 2 for $24. The waitress said she would take care of it so we handed her our debit card.  When she came back she said that we needed to give it a few days to post the refund!!  Why would they have charged both bills at once?  We didn't even get the receipt for the correct bill.  So frustrated that this restaurant can overcharge and take advantage of someone like my mother, who is in her 70's and wouldn't have looked at the bill because she trusts that no one would ever be overcharge and cheat!!

For some reason the hours posted on the door don't include closing times, either. There's just a blank space and then ""PM"". My husband and I ordered appetizers and were not very impressed by the foods' appearance. We ordered the sampler which said it came with chicken wings on the menu, and instead, came with chicken tenders. The marinara sauce for the mozzarella sticks was no good, and the artichoke dip was too thick. We also ordered the loaded cheese fries and the bacon bits were way too big for how dry they were. The fry-to-topping ratio was way out of proportion with a very small amount of melted shredded cheese, a large amount of bacon bits (seemingly meant for salad) and a minuscule amount of sour cream. The establishment is disgusting, with something sticky and brown covering the walls of the booths. The table was not clean when we were sat there, nor was it well-organized. The service was okay.

They know how to cook them, serve them quickly, and basically don't fart around in doing so.  The only burger-related complaint I have is the fries.  They are very stingy on the fries (which are otherwise quite good).Oh yes, and a secret in plain sight here -- the fruit iced teas and lemonades are *expletive* awesome.  Especially the lemonade.  It's not Minute Maid -- it really tastes fresh squeezed and is very tart.  The fruit is not puree or syrup -- they mash a bunch of blackberries or strawberries right in there.

WI6n1O0ahim_EfOGUJOlEw,2008-05-27,2,,"Maybe this is because I usually hate restaurant chains-- but this place was pretty horrible.I have definitely eaten at a Ruby Tuesday's before-- in fact, I have eaten at several. So I went in expecting the standard cheap all American meal to tide me over until my next course in the day.As a vegetarian would expect at an American-food restaurant, there are little to no options without meat. This was unfortunate but expected, so I just ordered their salad bar. I mean, how bad could it be if I make it myself?I went up to the salad bar and picked out a plate (which I had to fish for because the top two were DIRTY). There were only bland, unexciting options. Sure you had your lettuce and spinach base-- and then the regulars: tomatoes, green peppers, cucumbers. etc. Weirdly enough they weren't offering carrots that day (maybe they never do? or maybe they just ran out) but they only offered two cheeses (feta and I think cheddar). I don't know what I expected, but usually there is at least tuna, avocado, or pineapple offered at salad bars that I have seen in similar salad bar setups. The base for these salads seemed to be ham chunks and bacon chunks (once again, not giving us vegetarians better options even when using the salad bar).  I tried the potato salad which was quite bad, as it was loaded up with more of the mustard sauce then actual contents of the salad. They did not offer a lot of the last minute throw ons-- only bacon bits and sunflower seeds (what about croutons, those swirly crunchy things, or nuts?!)Our waitress was pleasant but forgetful, as my boyfriend sat with his fries for a long time before he got his ketchup. However, when she realized her mistake, she did RUN to the kitchen to get it. (And by the way, he ordered a Turkey burger that he seemed to like enough, but he did say it was nothing special).When we ate here, it was around two o'clock, and it was extremely dim inside. Sort of like I was wearing sunglasses. It was odd to have extreme mood lighting during the middle of the afternoon. Overall, the food is bland. I ate here on a Thursday, so maybe they don't put out a huge variety on the weekdays. But the selection they did provide didn't taste fresh or even interesting at all. The prices are seemingly cheaper than other restaurants-- however, the quality of the food is WAY overpriced. The salad bar was 8 dollars, and I could have gotten a huge salad at Wendy's that was way more delicious for only 4 dollars.

qYT8iB7WThvI_6rGuQ3MYQ,2017-07-31,5,,Ruby Tuesday is one of the coolest bars in Columbus. It's not the fucking chain of course. This is actually a hipster bar and music venue. It's not real big and it gets crowded. This is still pretty cool to see show. I like getting cheap drinks when there's not a show happening. It has pretty good specials. The draft list includes some okay local choices along with the usual. It's however mostly known as a place for music. This should be visited by any music fan at least once. It's not always the best acts but it's better than being in an arena far away from the action. The worst thing is the cover for which there is often. If you like local music go to Ruby Tuesday. It's fun making people think it's the shitty ass chain.

If i ever get a gigging-level band together again, i will definitely go there in search of a booking. It seems that the management is receptive to bands that are just starting to perform publicly. Last Summer i dropped in to Ruby Tuesday just twice on sweltering afternoons. During happy hour, the Bell's Two-Hearted is temptingly cheap, but i can't recall exactly the price.  I had to forcibly detach myself from the bar after three of them so that i didn't end up scrapping the day in a beer blur. The bartender, a young guy, was friendly and we both paid attention to Jeopardy and had some meta-exchanges over it. The bar is dingy, worn and dark.  I was confused for some time over references to Ruby Tuesday as a local music bar because i only knew of the chain concept restaurant. This atmosphere lies far on the other side of the continuum. All in all, my experiences at this bar have been pleasant and brief.

I've never been there before ten or so, so i don't know what it's like in the day, but judging by the giant frat dude who wanted to fight me for helping the drunken stranger puking on his yard around the corner, I suspect it might not be my thing.  And also judging by the little fratty dudes that were shirtlessly beer bonging Natty next door, I'm thinking the day crowd might suck.  But we probably have different musical tastes, so the frat kids and I are two ships passing in the night, apparently.I've always been impressed by the beer selection- Bell's Two Hearted in particular- and how inexpensive the scotch is.  If you like the band, but don't want to socialize, you can hide in the back.  If you don't like the band, there's always the patio (but you can't bring drinks out there after 1:30).

Those drunken monkeys in the NE corner of the stadium wearing the matching jerseys are the Hooligans.  They chant things like ""you suck ass hole!"" when the opposing goalkeeper is running up to take a goal kick and chant God-Only-Knows-What when the other team scores.  Take whatever they do and multiply it by 10.  That is what 'football' is supposed to be.The bar itself is fine.  I have seen a few live shows there and since I lived a block away for two years I would occasionally find myself in there for random shit from time to time.  Just go see the Hooligans.  Go online and buy tickets for a Crew game and go to Ruby Tuesdays an hour or two before game time.

DqTv8yXw7Nrnh73u45cgkw,2008-08-09,4,,"Despite sharing a name with a mediocre chain this is one of the absolutely best bars in town. If I were ever to leave Columbus this is one of those places I would always want to come back for. It's simply wonderful- live music, a patio, and a great bar to boot.The crowd at Ruby Tuesday's is by necessity fluid; it matches the music being played that night, like any live venue. Whenever I've gone, though, the crowd has always been positive force: supportive of the talent, happy, and very drunk in the best possible way. It's the antithesis to the bar scene directly on campus that I would have a hard time going to if my throat was on fire.Ruby Tuesday's has great prices on great beers, wonderful bar service, and a great line-up of rock acts from around town and from places even more exotic, like other states. There is a cover at Ruby Tuesday's, so you might want to make sure whoever is playing isn't completely offensive to your musical pallet; on the other hand the cover is usually pretty low, which means you can take a chance on a band you've never heard of. There's not many better venues of this size in town.

3Aj1L_rrSmCqjUnPu82Pgg,2008-06-20,4,,"Cheap PBR. An above average PA system. An endearingly bitter bar staff. A basement that conjures up thoughts of ""Silence of the Lambs."" For my money (which there is not a lot of), it doesn't get much better than Ruby Tuesday.Perhaps one of the most criminally overlooked bars in the campus area, Ruby Tuesday is a charmingly disheveled neighborhood dive bar that's got everything you need and nothing you don't. There are no cornhole boards, no jumbo pitchers of electric-blue vodka-infused sugar water, no ""country nights"" that attract droves of Jeep-driving frat guys. Ruby Tuesday's setup is rather spartan-  there's two pool tables, a stage, a bar, a porch, and the worst bathrooms you'll ever set foot in. And that's it. And that's how I like it.The great virtue of this place it's location, right in the heart of a neighborhood that's predominately populated by slackers (such as myself, at one point in time) that missed the boat on prime-location housing closer to campus and settled for one of the many duplexes that line the sketchier parts of the east residential area that Ruby Tuesday calls home. Ruby's is far enough from High St. to be insulated from the crowd that call bars like Too's and Four Keg's home, but close enough that it's still worth the hike. It's not unlikely for 2 out of 3 people in the bar to be stoned at any given time, and with a jukebox chocked full of bands like Ween, Phish, The Dead, and (of course) The Stones, it's hard to blame them. Like any campus bar, the live music rotation here can be hit or miss, the exception being a Wednesday night residency with The Floorwalkers, a local soul/funk act that's been picking up steam over the past year or so. What sets Ruby's apart from quite a few other local bars is it's sound system. For a bar that has a curious aroma of wood varnish and pee, the PA system here does a great deal of justice to just about any act that sets foot on the stage.If cheap drinks and a laid-back atmosphere that doesn't feel manufactured (just check out the basement, for crying out loud) is what you're in the market for, this place simply cannot be beat. If you've mistakenly stumbled upon Ruby's in search of a salad bar or a surf and turf special, however, you're in for a pleasant surprise.",https://www.yelp.com?hrid=3Aj1L_rrSmCqjUnPu82Pgg,en,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/eUJgFRpKRDTXX_mPAyeeXg/60s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=omRPvhGPyc05McdB4b8v4A,Pete C.,"Portland, OR",304,8,8,6,null,null,null,null,AQCBuvq9ud7D8iULhZy-7g

kYKM_5t8NsSr45BQrb1MuA,2007-06-21,4,,"My friends and I were arguing about whether or not Ruby's should be considered a dive or not. This was prompted by the yearly ""Best in Columbus"" poll that The Other Paper runs.I vote no. One, I feel that it's too big to be a dive. 2 rooms divided by half a wall is the basic layout of the establishment. In one room there's a small stage set up for small concerts with local bands. The other room is where the bar is located, as well as a pool table.Two, the place looks too nice to be a dive. The floors are made of a fantastic cabin inspired wood, and the patio is really nice, with a covered awning. There's a black iron gate surrounding the property and plenty of shrubbery provides a small shield from the street. A classic looking stained class sign reads ""Ruby Tuesday"" lets you know you're at the right place.Three, the atmosphere is really relaxed. It's not overly loud and clubby, it's more a neighborhood bar that substitutes as a music venue. I don't feel that you have to belong to a certain scene to hang out there.I guess why some people would consider it a dive is because of the really cheap drink prices. Like, seriously cheap pitchers of beer, and special cocktails during Happy Hour. But I don't think that should label a place as a dive. More like a blessing.So as you can read, Ruby Tuesday is absolutely not a dive bar. Except the bathrooms are horrendous.

Laid back, great atmosphere, with a little something for everyone. The porch is great in the summer, perfect for people watching and consuming pitcher after cheap pitcher of beer. Inside, there's a pool table with plenty of room to play, a comfortable bar where interesting conversations are always sure to arise, and off to the side a small-ish room where bands and local musicians play nightly. What I like about this place is that if you are not into watching the band, you can be in another room without it taking over your experience.The drinks here are ridiculously cheap. Last time I was there, happy hour had pitchers for $3.50. Yes, three dollars and fifty cents. If you really want to look for the best bargain there, they have a DRINK MENU hanging up, with prices! So no guessing how much your tab will be at the end of the night. All and all, great place.

As we were waiting we watch an employee we assume is off the clock filling a ToGo box full of food from the salad bar. We figured she is off the clock and just trying to leave.  Approximately 10 minutes go by until someone comes out and notices us and asks us to wait until she has found a section that was open. She found a small booth right next to a party of 9 people. The booth was still dirty so we had to wait for the worker to clean the booth. There was nobody else in the restaurant but it seemed important that we sit next to the party of 9... We sit down and Jennifer was our server. We had come in an hour before close, but now it felt closer so we try to decide and order fast. My girlfriend orders coconut shrimp and the endless salad bar. Our server comes to take our order and right as my girlfriend orders the salad bar... The employee that we thought had clocked off and filled her box with food came out and started tearing the salad bar down. She was still on the clock, she just didn't care that we were standing there waiting. My girlfriend speaks up a little bit louder and confirms that we could get the salad bar. Jennifer said that's not a problem. I also ordered the salad bar and the ribeye steak with the bourbon chicken mashed potatoes and broccoli. Jennifer goes to grab our drinks, and tells us we can go start on the salad bar. We stand up and see that there are no serving spoons, tongs, no plates, and the lettuce is gone. Jennifer comes back with our drinks and we ask if we can still get salad because there are no utensils. Jennifer goes back into the kitchen to confront the other worker and finally the other employee comes out with the plates... Slowly goes back into the kitchen and comes back out with the lettuce... Slowly goes back into the kitchen and brings out one spoon and sticks it in the ranch. She disappears into the kitchen and does not come back out. Jennifer comes to check on us and sees we haven't eaten yet. The girl had not brought the tongs and spoons so there was no way to serve ourselves. Jennifer apologizes again, goes in the kitchen, grabs a bunch of utensils and asks us what we would like to have on the salad bar to be sure we can grab whatever we would like. My girlfriend and I grab two plates and fill the plates with whatever we can have because we know there was not going to be a second trip. Everything we eat from the salad bar tasted like it was soaked in ham juice. Our food comes. The steak that I ate wasn't the best, but my girlfriend enjoyed my french fries.

5WHK7qlpdPj3I940gLFZsg,2020-01-10,4,,"Mac 'N Cheeseburger: I've actually never been to a Ruby Tuesday before. A couple weeks ago I saw an ad for this limited time item (while at the gym of all places) and was hooked. The cheeseburger is topped with enormous macaroni noodles, an exceptionally creamy cheese sauce, bacon bits, and I believe there was an actual slice of cheese on the beef patty. Another important note is the bun was soft, chewy, and was in proportion with the size of the patty (it sucks when the meat to bun ratio is off). I recommend picking up this item before it's gone, but it would be nice if it was made a permanent feature on the menu.  Doughboy approved!

I went last night with a Buy One/Get One coupon, and I am glad we had it.  Food wasn't horrible, but it certainly wasn't worth the $15 a plate that they charge.  I ordered the crab cake (Yep, just one) which came with two sides.  I politely asked the server if I could substitute the side(s) for soup and I was boldly told, ""No"".  I was a bit confused, and actually thought she was kidding for a minute.  Because the usual answer in a place like that is ""I'm sorry, but it will cost you (blank) extra to do that"".  And, my response is usually ""That's fine"".  I would rather pay the $1 or so extra and not waste all of the food I am not going to eat.  So, I picked out two sides and asked for the cup of soup before my meal anyway.  When my food came the server asked if we needed anything, and I reminded her about the soup that she had forgetten to bring and she said she would go right away and get it.  Never came back :(  Also, never got a refill on soda. :(When the bill finally came it wasn't on seperate checks like we had requested, so she had to take it back and print it again.

The guy working in the area that cooks the meat's was asked by a gentleman next to me to wipe a plate because it was wet, so the worker took a rag that was laying around and wiped it, the man said ""That was a dirty trick, that rag was dirty"" then I noticed that, sure enough, that guy took a really dirty rag to wipe the thing! The guy was nice, he could have demanded a free meal or something, but he just put the plate down and walked away....The waitress tho, was nice and attentive to us... but two buffet meals and 3 orange juices?  Not sure that 50 + is worth it.  Also, if they are that dirty as to wipe dishes with dirty cloths, I wonder what else they do to cut corners....Guess no more Ruby Tuesday for us.",https://www.yelp.com?hrid=WdL1yIR5PPzyAohPnCWgNA,en,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/4mZU8xtcpzCzLI2XmFKEaw/60s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=g2Y9dtceJ8pqR1Z1yCp0jg,Donna S.,"West Des Moines, IA",4,0,0,0,null,null,null,null,P9_2LRWep_DYHbPnQAjnfw

I liked that the salad bar was open during the pandemic and masks and gloves were required at the salad bar (disposable gloves provided) which worked well. Salad bar was decent, nothing remarkable or bad for that matter. Ranch dressing was watery.  I had a full rack Of ribs, wanted onion rings but they were out so had fries and zucchini. The ribs were ""OK"" and what I expected. On the dry side but slathered with bbq sauce to compensate and meat easily came off the bone. Zucchini was excellent and piping hot fries were just ok - could have been hotter and less soggy. She had Asiago chicken which was super cheesy and good. Chicken was very tender and same sides I had. It was a decent meal and value (with 1 free entree) but at full price I may have been slightly dissatisfied.

The Dockside was $14.99 and you would think that the salad bar came with it, but it doesn't: you have to pay an extra $2.99. The fish entrée was not impressive. The tilapia was dry and tasteless, the grilled shrimp were forgettable and the worst of the three was the fish I was looking forward to eating, the grilled Atlantic Salmon. I ordered it medium rare thinking that I was eating from the sushi grade menu at the Wood n' Tap. The waitress came back and told me that the chef advised her that I might get sick if I ate the salmon medium rare. I usually order it rare, but I took her advice and I was very glad I did. I don't know how long the salmon sat around in the refrigerator, but it was not fresh fish. As I ate it, I could taste the age. I was lucky I didn't get sick, just a little queasy a couple of hours later. I downed an Alka Selzer and it saved the day, since I was flying out the next morning.

Several people walked in and back out for the same reason.   My friend asked to speak to the manager.  He came by And introduced himself.   He blamed lack of staff for not having the bar.   He was there to hire staff Only.   Supposedly he worded 19 hours.   I'm assuming he was wanting some sympathy but he was talking to two self employed women that have worked hard.   I think he could have come up with a solution to the problem.  In  nineteen hours he could have the lettuce cut up, veggies,    But all we heard was blame to the staff.     If you are the manager wouldn't you offer customers a discount or something instead of letting them walk out.?    Why is there a turnover at the restaurant?   They are always hiring new staff.   Something isn't right Or they wouldn't quit.  Could it be the manager doesn't respect his staff!   He definitely isn't a team player or he would have done more  instead of blaming the staff.

trUTs4tqJlaQzLtysUUa5A,2022-04-25,4,,Thank goodness this place is attached to the Marriott. It made my stay at the Marriott palatable. The food here is nothing to write home about. I wasn't expecting gourmet greatness and I certainly didn't get it. What I got was pub style food that tasted decent and went down easy with a few draft beers. The service is where this place shines. My bartender/server Jesse was outstanding. Quick with the refills and was able to steer me to some decent menu items. If you're looking for a cold drink and something to put in your stomach this pace fits the bill. **Note don't get the BBQ Chicken Nachos.

The two of us were sat after waiting for a few minutes, despite the restaurant being empty. No big deal. The server becomes visibly upset when we asked for a booth, which was discomforting and confusing. We waited for 15 minutes as other patrons arrived in small groups, we over heard the server seating them and taking their orders during this time.

This restaurant is connected to the Courtyard Marriott where I've stayed on several occasions. I ordered the Hickory Bourbon Salmon Grilled Zucchini and Mashed Potatoes. My mom ordered a cheese burger and fries. I would've given 5 stars but I wasn't happy with the portion sizes.  I could count how many zucchini's were on my plate and they probably did as well. For the price they should give a little more zucchini and mashed potatoes other than that the food overall was good. Mom enjoyed hers as well. Since COVID is still thriving and numbers are rising.  I was leery about dining in the restaurant. But It wasn't crowded and we didn't have to wait long for our food to arrive to our table. Would I recommend? Yes  Would I eat again?

reoTncwHzZVdbygQ9Os9UA,2008-04-21,3,,"Get it right people. The restaurant is named ""Ruby Tuesday"". Its not a plural, or a possesive.This one is right near our office. Our team calls it the home of the $20 lunch, because if you have two beers and a burger, the cost is $20 with tip. Not a big deal, unless you have two kids and you are sending them to the $4,000 per head summer camp.This one is new. Its clean and very attractive inside. The service is good. My favorites (for lunch) the Fresh Avocado Quesadilla: Ripe avocados, grated Swiss cheese, and pico de gallo in a grilled flour tortilla. I also like the Chicken Quesadilla (both off the appetizer menu.)The guys here favor these burgers (copy and paste from the Ruby Tuesday site - ignore all the marketing jazz like ""artisan"", ""premium"", ""perfectly ripe"", etc.)Smokehouse BurgerTopped with melted Tillamook artisan cheddar cheese, premium bacon, tangy barbecue sauce, and crisp onion straws.Alpine Swiss BurgerWith melted Swiss cheese and sauted baby portabella mushrooms. Ruby Minis Four mini burgers topped with melted American cheese and crisp onion straws, garnished with mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup, and a crisp pickle. I'll add - good choice with the salad bar.Bison Bacon CheeseburgerRange-fed bison, grilled to perfection and topped with premium bacon and melted American cheese. I like this:Buffalo Chicken BurgerA tender chicken breast golden fried, tossed in spicy Buffalo sauce, and topped with melted Swiss cheese. Garnished with garlic mayonnaise.Good fries here too. Usually lots of corporate types at lunch time at this location.Why three stars? Plusses, clean, convenient, and good service.Downers? The $20 tab for lunch with two beers.

The steaks we ordered were very thin cut, a little more cooked than we usually get, but I'm sure that's because they were cut so thin. The French fries were cold and stale tasting, we did get a second batch which was better. The restaurant was out of baked potatoes at 6:00 which shouldn't happen, they don't go bad that quickly that you can't keep extra on hand. There was just no leadership in the kitchen, a lot of people complaining about the wait time for the food and then the food. So sorry to see this happen, we are regulars and we don't want to see this Ruby Tuesday's close but if this keeps happening people will no longer come here. Please try harder to regain control. Better cooks needed. Our last visit was just as bad, food wise.

The salad bar was full of wilted, mushy vegetables that had gone bad, along with over saturated macaroni and potato salads. The server forgot my soup, but I should have known that was a sign to not consume it -- it was a premade, bagged soup. He said the cook forgot it but by the time it made it to the table, it had a layer of film over the top. I almost ordered a burger but glad I didn't because my mother-in-law's burger made her sick.

Well, my previous experience was that they had nice beers and paid a lot of attention to food quality but this time, it was just.. good enough. The salad bar was pretty wilted and nasty but I did find a good macaroni salad that I gladly wolfed down. Burger came out unceremoniously plopped on my plate but it was at least cooked the way I ordered it. The waitstaff seemed to be enjoying themselves immensely with... whatever they kinds of flirting or courting rituals they were up to. I wasn't going to $@# block the fellas so I just chalked it up to being a laid-back southern thing and not fret about the service.

bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,2022-08-08,1,,"My expectations weren't very high considering all these reviews. However, if I had to starve or eat at this establishment again, I'd starve. There are many factors that made me decide to steer nearly every single person considering going to this establishment far, far away. Cleanliness: I don't think there are enough staff members to keep this place clean. It's apparent that they're overwhelmed by the patrons that decided to visit this establishment. It needs a thorough power washing and bleaching, as well as an overhaul on the tables and seats. 1/5 stars. The reason they get 1 star, my table wasn't wobbly. Service: Unfortunately, I don't think our server was ever properly trained. We continuously had other peoples food coming to our table, we had our food going to other tables--our drinks took well over 20 minutes to arrive, and they weren't anything extravagant. Orders weren't correct and the wait was excruciatingly long. If we didn't opt to get the salad bar, we would have sat waiting for our food for 48 minutes. Again, nothing too difficult was ordered. 0/5 stars...I could have done a better job with no training and provided our table with better service than we received. Food: I'm not quite sure how I managed to eat half of my burger or how my friend managed to eat what we called mysterymeattacodillas. The other item ordered was the Triple Play, and the shrimp that came with it tasted as if it was bought from the grocery store frozen section, ribs were dry and didn't even look edible. The salad bar held us over, but it was not refreshed, bowls were bare from the time we arrived until the time we left. Half of our items were under heat lamps for at least 5 minutes. Again, not expecting much, but this really was a terrible experience. 1/5 stars, because our French fries were fresh. It's pretty hard to mess French fries up though...It took over 20 minutes to be able to pay our bill. Our server didn't have any idea how to reconcile our checks and repeatedly told us a manager was coming to assist.

HsNQZVGi9f3ylOfoSj69BQ,2009-11-09,4,,"FUBLE Diaries: Episode 4 * Just a brief disclaimer, to say that while I am not currently employed there (and it wasn't this location) I worked for Ruby Tuesdays for years. You are welcome to keep this in mind , when you read this...""review"" Our damp day in Philly was behind us and after a rough few days for Jason, of travelling and hard living, he was ready to crash. Aside from the Arthritic condition, he also has a bum kidney, which takes alot out of him. Not wanting to impose on my family while he was sick (although I offered) , Jason preferred to get a room so he could rest up for the Main Event of the Eagles Game the next day. I figured the best bet, was to get a place near the airport, although with game 3 of the World Series set to begin that night, and a bunch of Yankees fans needing to rest their inflated heads, I wasn't optimistic. However, after utilizing an iphone ( There's an app for that!) he was able to get a pretty sweet room, for a decent price. The 2 other guys and myself, decided to pregame at Ruby Tuesdays, located in the same lot, to make a plan for the evening. Having worked there for years, i wasn't excited to be back in a Ruby Tuesdays. Nothing personal, I actually think their food is better than average (*wink @ DJ) but I think anyone who has left a place of employment can understand. Not to matter, we wouldn't be there for long...or would we. I tried to take notes on how these Alaskans operate. These guys walk into any place and after only a few minutes...own it! They are, however, armed with one of the best icebreakers Ive ever seen, "" We're from Alaska."" Its amazing how this gets peoples immediate interest. I'm thinking of having a fake McLovin ID made up, only with Alaska. This was how it went down on this particular evening. Dean, Mike and I sat at one end of the bar, and noticed a lovely blue haired Golden Girl, sitting at the other end. Without a word, Mike got up and began talking to the woman, who laughed, pointed at us and smiled. When Mike came back, I asked what he said . "" I told her Dean was coming over to buy her a drink"". It was then that we looked over, to see Betty White waving at us! Not wanting to disappoint, Dean walked over and bought her a Native Alaskan shot, The Duck Fart, which is a delicious combination of Kahlua, Baileys and Crown Royal. She loved it, and the flood gates opened. Turns out that entire side of the bar was her family, sons daughters, uncles, brothers, etc. These guys had befriended an entire clan, in about 2 minutes. What followed involved much laughter, back slapping, shots bought and good times. I distinctly remember that Dean was behind the bar making shots at one point. If you've ever worked at a corporate restraunt chain, you'll understand how rare a sight that is. These guys were not only allowed to do this, but were encouraged by the Managers with much fanfare. They became such good friends with the Management at Ruby Tuesday that if I ever need to get a job at RT again, I'm going to go through the Alaskans. So our pregame , became the Game itself. We ended up watching the entire World Series game there, and I'm afraid to know what they dropped there that night. I guess that one of the side effects of bar popularity that I cant afford. When all was said and done with this trip, we all agreed that that night at Ruby Tuesday's, was one of the highlights.

Not necessarily our waitresses fault, but partially.  3 tables sitting including us another couple walked in, by this time we had our drinks and ordered.  The other two tables had their food already.  Table #4 got their food well before us, still not a horrible issue.  Finally our food starts to come out 2 of my 4 kids got mild wings, one came out Buffalo, child 3 got a burger, I got a quesadilla... the other 2 people (1 child and my husband) got no food.  20 min passes and still no food!  We went to the bar and questioned 2x by now and was told the kitchen is slow, we are the ONLY table in the restaurant with no food!  We didn't see our waitress in this 20 min span, I went to the waitress station and got napkins and ketchup, I also went and got a rag from another table that still wasn't bussed or wiped when we had a spill and cleaned the mess up.  No management skills at this location at all!  This should not be acceptable at any business much less a restaurant.  When the remaining food did arrive it was inedible, my husband couldn't even bite through his chicken sandwich because it was so over cooked, the youngest child's pasta and sauce was ice cold and the fries tasted as if they were left from the day before.  Items on the salad bar actually had ice on them as if they were frozen.  We could see at least 3-4 people in the kitchen so actually making edible food (burgers, sandwiches, wings and kid pasta) shouldn't be challenging.

j-4OtxMRlYlqOOhAWrce6Q,2009-03-07,2,,"My parents offered to take me out to dinner tonight, and since it wasn't a special occasion on my behalf (ie, my birthday, etc) it meant that they would be choosing the place. Which, by extension, meant it wouldn't be any place remotely interesting, and more than likely would mean my mom had a coupon for the location in question. So...Ruby Tuesday, here we come.On the one hand you want to think that any place that has a line out the door at 9 PM is a pretty happening spot, but it sure didn't feel like one. This is the kind of place where zombies will congregate during the great undead apocalypse...much like a mall. The Plymouth Meeting Mall is barely 5 minutes away...coincidence? Though I think you can avoid having your entrails ripped from your body at Ruby Tuesday (as of the time of this writing), I would still keep that in mind. Oh, and shoot for the head.Anywhooooo, in terms of ""modern American chain dining blackholes"", RT is better than TGI Friday's (not anywhere near as cheesy), and also better than Applebees (its not as...classless. But in a sense I guess RT harvests the absolute value of negative class, so I suppose that is a good thing? I don't know). Its better in the way that the 3rd circle of Hell isn't as bad as the 5th. Make sense?So, yea...we were seated after waiting about 10 minutes, and after a bit too long a young guy walks up and asks if we've yet been helped. Nope. Oh, well I guess I will be your server. You...guess? Is this serving by committee? Every man for himself? Ok, whatever. To drink I will have...oh, wait, he's gone. You see, rule #1 is you take a drink order right off the bat...maybe people don't know what they want yet, but you at least give them the option. We end up giving our drink orders a few minutes later, and then the drinks took almost 15 minutes to come out. Don't think it was the servers fault, but there is no way that a glass of wine, glass of beer, etc. should take that long. No way. Ok, finally, we order our meals (after our drinks arrived...surely we cannot decide on our meal with no beverages in front of us). Almost 45 minutes later they come out. Sigh. I had the ""Asian Salmon and Shrimp"", somehow forgetting my rule not to order seafood at pooptastic chain restaurants. I guess the picture swayed me. It was actually edible, which counts for one star in the review. They skimped on the shrimp (less mercury for me...hooray!), and the salmon wasn't overcooked. Rice was...present. I've had worse.My parents seemed to like their meal, but as you might infer they aren't terribly picky. I guess that is a good thing...you don't have to try very hard to be satisfied. I am almost jealous. The mere presence of a coupon trumps all other considerations. No wonder I am confused.I must toss props in the direction of previous reviewers Laura D. and Jae L...for the former, the restaurant did indeed have ""that smell"". And not in a cool, Skynyrd way, but it was the same exact smell that the retirement home kitchen in which I worked during high school had oozing from every corner. Not fun. As for the latter, all the TV's were fuzzy, including the several sets that said ""call 800-xxx-xxxx to receive service"". Shall I expound at length the enormous degree of ineptitude it takes to display such a video feed, continuously, during the weekend rush? As in the way it sorta shows the customer how little they (the business) really GAF about you? Or should I discuss the very nature of a ""restaurant"" (as in, not a sports bar) that feels the need to stuff TV's in every corner? No? Ok.All that said, this might be a decent location to grab a quick lunch during the week if you are nearby. Not a great place, but also not a place with a drive-thru window (that is like...the 9th circle or something. I don't know how many circles are down/up there).

Wasn't to bad of a wait but got home the food was extremely cold and my burger buns were burnt and my burger was raw.

ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,2021-10-16,1,,"Worst meal and service I can ever remember.  I have never written a review before but just felt I owed it to the paying public this time.  There was a sign on the door that the fryer was down so we couldn't order anything fried.  At 1:00 on a Saturday afternoon there was only one other table seated when we arrived.  Should have been my first clue.  We were 2 adults and 2 children.  The children ordered plain hamburgers and one also got the salad bar.  One adult ordered the salad bar and I ordered broccoli cheese soup. We also had 2 Cokes, 1 iced tea and a water.  We waited well over an hour for the hamburgers and  the soup.  The soup was cold and had sat so long it had congealed on the top and shook like jello when I touched it.  The waitress was still at the table and I asked her was it normal for the soup to be like that.  She couldn't even be bothered to answer.  I told her she could take it  back which she did.  She didn't offer me an appology, a fresh bowl or a different menu item.  Just left and never came back.  We never were asked if the rest of the meal was ok or if we needed drink refills.  I wanted to walk out but we waited way, way to long for the check.  I asked here if there was a manager and she said yes and turned around and went back in the kitchen.  When the manager arrived I told her how bad everything had been.  She said the soup was fine that it had just sat under a heat lamp.  That could be true but it must have been there for an hour.  Her idea of compensation was for me to give her my address and she would send me a discount for my next visit.  I told her I  was traveling and just passing through and I would not be coming back.  I asked if there was anything she could do for us today since I didn't even get to eat anything after spending 1-1/2 hours in her fine establishment.  She said nope, sorry nothing she could do.  I wouldn't send my worst enemy there.  I can be very understanding that things happen but these guys didn't even try to care.The other adult in our party used the ladies room and said it was  very dirty and had smeared feces everywhere.  That's all I will say about that.They blame so many problems on covid but they were not busy, only saw 3 takeout orders go past us during our 1-1/2 hrs, and the waitresses and hostess were just sitting in the bar area on their phones.  A guy came out of the back with an apron on and a cigarette in his hand.  He went outside and smoked right outside our window.  I don't know if he was the cook and took a break or what.

0sRGnzTKt_iOxAZSn3untg,2012-07-09,5,,"My husband wanted steak for lunch, so we tried this restaurant. The location is very close to Fort Stewart. A large banner on the exterior of the restaurant advertises a 10% military discount. Bonus...we found one parking spot in total shade under a big tree.We had a friendly server, Jennifer, and she did an excellent job serving us. She was always smiling and very patient, as the menu is full of very appetizing choices, which caused my husband to change his mind and get the New Orleans Seafood, side of mashed potatoes and the create-your-own salad bar. I decided to have the same since that fiasco of a meal at Chili's the other night. The salad table was not your average salad bar, it had a good selection of vegetables and a wide variety of salad dressings along with a bottle of oil and vinegar. There were sunflower seeds and croutons to add crunch. These weren't your boring, rock-hard white bread croutons, these croutons had just the right amount of crunch, and were made from pumpernickle bread. They were unbelievably delicious, I wish I had put more on my salad. At the table, our garlic cheesy biscuits were waiting for us. They were small, but tasty, and ended up being the right portion size to go with our salads. We had also ordered an appetizer of artichoke and spinach dip with tortilla chips. The chips were whole pieces and had a splash of blue corn tortilla chips for color. The dip was hot and stayed hot, even as we ate our entrees. It tasted delicious and we had no complaints about it. I had a sweet tea, and it was the perfect amount of sweet, not to much and not too little. My husband had the strawberry lemonade, and it was very lemony sour, not even a hint of strawberry flavor. He was disappointed.Our entrees were served hot and the presentation was appetizing. The seasoning was a tad bit excessive, but it didn't stop us from enjoying our tilapia and shrimp. The mashed potatoes with chopped parsley had good flavor.I was so satisfied that I was too full for dessert. I don't even know what desserts they had, but if they were anything like the rest of our meal, I know they would be delicious. There's always next time...and there will definitely be a next time.

I tried the salad bar, the items were fresh and the area was clean and well maintained. The best part was the fruit ice tea. I choose the berry and it came in a tall glass with muddled berries in the bottom and a sprig of mint on the top, delish!I was only bothered by 2 things while I was there, and they surprisingly weren't the food. They had a dish with steak, potatoes, veggies and lobster mac and cheese. I asked if I could just order the lobster mac and cheese. First they told me no, then they said it would be $11. They could have sold it separately, and it definitely would not cost them $11 to do this. The second was they were way overstaffed. There were several servers standing by the entrance with nothing to do and it was a little off-putting when you walked in.

hnm9k28r39eyrO_-S1Se5w,2022-01-03,2,,"Ruby Tuesday is one of my favorite ""go-to"" restaurants for a quick, decent dinner. Though I have previously reviewed this restaurant favorably, I was not happy with our last experience. We ordered dinner on Sunday for pick up. I went with my usual (hickory bourbon salmon, rice, grilled zucchini); my husband had the bourbon chicken with broccoli and mac and cheese; my daughter ordered the chicken carbonara. Though my meal was good and my daughter enjoyed her pasta, someone seemed to have dropped the ball in the presentation of my husband's meal. Usually, the veggies are separated for the to-go meals, especially when there is a sauce involved. Who wants their veggies swimming in a sauce intended for the meat??? Just hurt looking at how this meal was prepared/packed for pick up. My daughter picked up the order and didn't bother looking before leaving. If I had picked up the meals and noticed how my husband's meal was packed, I would have returned it. My husband got the bourbon chicken he ordered, but he also got ""bourbon broccoli!"" Seems someone just didn't care when packing this meal. I know there are plenty of problems in this world and having an abundance of bourbon sauce on one's broccoli may not be a big deal. But, for folks like me who like for the food to not only taste good but look good presentation-wise, I was a bit disappointed in Ruby Tuesday this time.

I also go to Ruby's to enjoy watching sports on their bar-area TV's.  On the most recent visit, that was a BIG mistake as their reception apparently is quite poor during periods of inclement weather.  The smokehouse burger and fries were great, the salad bar was terrific and well-stocked and very fresh; staff were wearing masks; the manager was present out front throughout my visit (which u don't see everywhere); everything pretty solid, but one problem: no life in the bar, no light-hearted chat among 3 bartenders!  They made 0 effort to talk with me, to make me feel welcome, to make me feel part of the gang.  Very poor approach; only words to me were to take my order and take my payment.

So I online ordered two rib meals, and a honey bourbon chicken meal, with 3 fries and three side salads. I was all ready for pick up on time as promised. Came home, mixed all the salads together into one bowl, threw the awesome fries into the oven for a few minutes to make sure they weren't soggy from riding in a styrofoam box, and we had ourselves an awesome buffet in no time. So it worked out great. Ribs and chicken were awesome. French fries were very good, and I normally don't even eat French fries.

First off, there was a nice large parking lot with plenty of parking, even a couple of side parking spots off to the right as you're pulling in.Upon walking in we noticed how clean everything looked and how nice the lighting was, not too bright or too dark.  Past by the salad bar and it looked great. Will have to try that the next go round.We were immediately greeted and seated even though it was kind of packed when we walked in around 7:15. We had a wonderful waitress named Morgan, who was very pleasant and attentive the whole time and always had a smile when she came to our table.  My son and I both got the Mango sweet tea.  Loved it!! Will have to go back just for that tea alone!!!The food...they bring you out these complimentary garlic cheese biscuits that we devoured in two seconds.  Very yummy.  There were so many choices on the menu I picked out five different dinners before I finally narrowed it down to two...the Thai Phoon Shrimp appetizer and the popcorn shrimp dinner with fries and baked potato. My son got the shrimp fondue with tortilla chips. We were obviously in a shrimp mood.Everything, and I do mean everything, was cooked perfectly. Nice size shrimp with both appetizers and with my meal. Fondue was thick and cheesy, baked potato with butter and sour cream was cooked just right. Nice portion sizes too. Even as much as we ate we still had leftovers to take home.  Even though it was full in there our appetizers and dinner still came out pretty quick.  I can't say enough about our wonderful experience tonight. The most awesome part of the dinner had to be when our waitress, Morgan, brought my receipt back after paying and she told me that a table had an extra coupon so she went ahead and applied it to our check! I have NEVER had any waiter or waitress to do that for us. EVER. Kudos to Ruby Tuesday for having one of the most compassionate and thoughtful waitresses that I've ever come across in my life.

It doesn't take a college degree to figure out a seating chart. -Waiters/waitresses aren't any better, they're slow and rude with customers.-Their bartender needs to be schooled in pouring drinks, because there's little to no alcohol in those alcoholic beverages.-Salad bar looks like it hasn't been refreshed all day.-Their plates have changed to small white appetizer plates to look modern, but you get less food and pay more.-They're stingy with their biscuit basket. Your food takes forever to make so they need to keep the bread coming. -That lobster macaroni is pathetic. You get a few bites thrown on an appetizer plate for $15.Pros:-10% military discount.

elxH7v2dPl9AnctE2yXU0g,2014-01-05,3,,"Gee, but it's nice to be greeted by a genuinely charismatic, interested hostess.  The lady of oriental background that took us to our table was an absolute delight.  We conversed about the fact that we were from Canada, about her family in Canada, about our ongoing travels, etc. and when we left, she actually remembered our destination and wished us ""good travels"".  Showed us that she was actually listening to us!  A rare thing these days!  Thank you.The restaurant itself was lovely and looked clean - at least the parts that we walked through.  The salad bar was enticing and a nice addition - there are far too few of these left anymore in my opinion - I love a salad bar!  This one was not hugely extensive, but everything that was there was excellent and fresh and lots of it - it was a really, really nice addition.  That alone would bring me back!Because I know my limitations, I only ordered an appetizer quesadilla to go with my salad bar trip.  I had such a good trip to the salad bar, that I ended up bringing the quesadillas home.  They will not go to waste - they were very tasty!  Rick ordered the Seafood trio which came with a crab cake, shrimp wrapped with bacon and a lobster tail.  The only problem with his meal is that the lobster was bad.  Bad as in off.  Mushy.  Bad.  We brought that to the managers' attention and to her credit, she promptly had a new one brought out which was much better.All in all, a really nice dining experience.  The wait staff is vey good.  I'm thinking that they could have used a few more doing the cleaning up and setting up of tables or vacuuming up after people leave their tables.  One thing that I have a real problem with and it has nothing to do with the restaurant itself is - What happened to people removing their hats when they sit down at a table to eat a meal?  When did that bit of etiquette end????  We sat beside a table of 5 - Only one little girl did not have a hat on - even Mom had a hat on and left it on during the whole meal!!!!  What is up with that????  Is this an Alabama thing?  Or is this just something that young people do now??????  How rude!  Do restaurants not have the right to ask that people remove their hatwear??????? I think that's just rude and disgusting - and I know that it has nothing to do with the restaurant itself UNLESS they can control it.

l6Fxn0mM1Gahqaf9nOdtyg,2022-07-25,1,,"July 25, 2022- First off, when approaching the salad bar, all the plates had crumbs/spots. I had to ask for clean plates. When making my salad you could see that they didn't flip the vegetables correctly. There was old salad at the bottom of the bowl, and they just keep adding fresh on top. The tongs were handle down in one of the vegetables. The salad dressing where all in other dressings. I understand that is from the people self serving, however they should have better maintenance. After eating my salad I found a hair on my mushroom. It couldn't be mine because I have no facial hair and had a hat on. After finishing our drinks we noticed a black residue on the underside... it was mold. We talked to the manager to make him aware of these violations. We weren't offered any discounts and they did not comp our meals either. I told the manager that I would never eat there again. It was my first and last time there. I am very disappointed and nauseated.

The cheese biscuits when your first seated are great too! The mango tea with the real chunks of fruit in them you can never go wrong with either I love the combo of tea and mango!

fojwTzjPZdRQQwGNNJRbzw,2012-07-15,3,,The service is great. They have a nice salad bar and excellent WiFi. The noise level is good and even with lots of people it does not seem crowded.The one thing that keeps me from going back more often are the very uncomfortable bench seats used for the booths. They are very old vinyl covered springs.,https://www.yelp.com?hrid=fojwTzjPZdRQQwGNNJRbzw,en,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/SB2C9xPV5s6W5gj9rmFylA/60s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=339VmWwdQuCtHrjG4Pc8Kw,Johnny G.,"Bellevue, WA",77,2,2,0,null,null,null,null,vbNum3mSE3iUA__fnvDBzw
xhwVtur-Ofu2FJ3XTzIgXA,2012-05-04,2,,"I just ended up here again.  I cannot stress how good the staff is.  Buuuut, let me talk about the food.Ruby Tuesday has gone downhill over the years.  As far as chains go, this used to be one of the better ones.  I've ended up here two weeks in a row with a group of people, mainly due to where it's located.  To quote another member of our party ""Hopefully this is the last we see of Ruby Tuesday's.""  While we were waiting for our orders, the waitress brought out some free samples of their new biscuits.  They were actually pretty good.  Buttery, a little spice.  I enjoyed them.  After being dissapointed with my sliders from last week, I decided to get one of their regular burgers.  I've had them in the past, and was always pleased.  So, I order an Alpine Swiss Burger medium rare.  It comes out partially well done.  I say partially because it was pink on the edges of just one half.  I don't even know how they accomplished that.  The bottom half of the bun was soaked with grease, and fell apart.  Now, grease usually means flavor.  This tasted more like vegetable oil than beef fat.  The beef itself was flavorless.As a side, I got the onion rings.  They didn't have the normal breading that slides off of the onion as you try to take a bite.  Instead, it was this sharp, hard razor breading that kind of hurt to chew.  Again, more of the flavorless oily weirdness.  My cranberry juice was good, though.Another person in our party got the buffalo chicken sliders, and mentioned that they were good.  They definitely looked proper, so I'll give them that.  Ruby Tuesday used to have really good burgers, but now everything just strikes me as a desperate attempt to hang on.  I'm hoping I don't end up here again next week.",https://www.yelp.com?hrid=xhwVtur-Ofu2FJ3XTzIgXA,en,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/aYVdPoh4zLU-6qg8fKiknw/60s.jpg,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=DblvGgyFSa84uUuzVnDK9Q,David B.,"West Suffield, CT",135,1,1,0,null,null,null,null,vbNum3mSE3iUA__fnvDBzw
