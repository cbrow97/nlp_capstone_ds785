0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,BurgerPalace was a treat back in the day (It may have been a Tuesday)Not today.
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,Boy was this sad.
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,I was bummed at first sight.
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,The place looked like the 90's called and wanted everything in the place back like stuck in 35 years ago kind of feel and look.
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,"The attempts to promote are a nice effort but seems so over blown ""Win a Million Dollars!"""
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,But the risk is maybe ruin your health or get sick or just plain waste your money on substandard food?
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,"So our ""meal"" was not good from start to finish."
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,The staff needs some real training.
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,The training videos don't seem to be translating into real life results.
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,The thing that struck me was how can you be happy if the place is always kinda empty and the staff keeps getting cut and makes no money?
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,Take that million from the contest and apply it to the staff and getting the place really revived to today's dining needs.
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,"The Salad bar is a throwback feel but an area that could be modernized and improved to be actually healthy but I am not sure that this is that certain something special that the diner of today will respond to so strongly that it will resonate as ""Special."""
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,"This is where I am at a loss regard Ruby's, ""What is special about the place that really move the meter?"""
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,Ribs are back!
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,"But I do not smell wood smoke when I walk in so you kinda lose me here because I know in a chain what I am going to get, possibly ok ribs but not the type of ""oh wow Ribs"" that you might get at that wood smoker Rib-house down the street."
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,"The parking lot sets the tone, the front entry and btw ""What is that smell in the entry way?"""
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,Fix that asap or..well you know.
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1, That whole first impressions thing...wow that was just wrong.
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,That did not say delicious food ahead.
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,What we discovered was we were wrong for not heeding this lil warning.
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,No attention at the front and waitresses looked at us but did nothing.
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,Great why make us wait that long when the place was so empty on a Friday night prime dinner time.
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,The service was not great but it was not the servers fault (We tipped strong because we feel her pain) but then the wait time for an empty restaurant seemed a bit long but not end of the world long.
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,The food however was a massive disappointment.
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1, I am in the wrong here too because I feel like if I am spending near $60 for a quick bite it should at least be pleasant and satisfying.
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,This was neither of those.
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,"What I did wrong to was tried to reduce the stress of an already  uncomfortable experience by telling the ""Manager?"" that everything was OK when it was not."
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,"I felt like I was being robbed that I had to pay for food that was not as good as an average person would expect quality wise, or flavor wise, for these prices."
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,"My error there I will own that one, the other one was selecting this place because it had less of a crowd which meant hey faster service and I am hungry, lets go!"
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,But not so much.
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1, 
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,"One thing I would suggest to BurgerPalace as a chain research the seating and comfort needs of today and change, change is good."
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,"The seating is uncomfortable and I get that may be a wise choice if you are trying to speed up table turnover, this place needs to do anything it can to be remotely appealing."
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,"Our meal was so bland and forgettable I question where the wheels went off the tracks but they need to rethink, well, everything."
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,Seasonings would be a plus.
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,I am at a loss how this store is open.
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,If I owned it I would close it and start over.
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,"This needs so much it will take big money time and a team of sincerely commited experts to focus on the entire concept of community involvement, promotion, building, planning, execution, hiring, training, and everything required to get a winning recipe."
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,They need to call Robert Irvine from the Food TV Network to revamp everything or something.
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,The place needs something more than just a signature salad to win as a restaurant.
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,If the kitchen is not producing food of a high enough quality as prices are out of control people will not step up and open our wallets for mediocrity.
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1, The next time I set foot in one the BurgerPalace they will need to have made some big changes.
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,"Nothing personal more of a ""To my standards"" Issue."
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,"Prove me wrong you guys I want to see you do well I am rooting for you, but you have a mountain of challenge to overcome."
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,"I will be watching to see you make me eat my words by doing all the right things, however I will be watching from afar."
0,ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,1,FWIW
1,b3hU0QXM4DQ77LvJkm4H-g,5,"My signature salad at BurgerPalace Yummy, yummy, yum!I already placed my order for my meal and drink."
1,b3hU0QXM4DQ77LvJkm4H-g,5,No drinking tonight.
1,b3hU0QXM4DQ77LvJkm4H-g,5,It's not crowded here right now.
1,b3hU0QXM4DQ77LvJkm4H-g,5,That makes things more enjoyable.
2,3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,1,"Have been going here for years on a very, very occasional basis and it never totally sucked."
2,3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,1,"It had always been a mediocre experience in food quality and service, but it was convenient...this recent visit will most definitely be my last."
2,3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,1,First thing I noticed was the sticky table...then the sticky menus...then the sticky salt and pepper shakers...onto the ketchup bottle and beyond.
2,3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,1,Yuk.
2,3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,1,"Against my better judgement, I ordered coffee."
2,3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,1,Big mistake.
2,3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,1,"It was coffee, I guess, but litereally tasteless."
2,3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,1,Then I ordered chicken tenders and CRISPY fries.
2,3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,1,"If I order fries, I specifically order them well done because they are normally underdone no matter where you go and browning them negates some of the greasiness."
2,3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,1,"Obviously, the waitress (yes, I use gender specific labels...sue me."
2,3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,1,"I was a waitress for years and never took offense at being referred to as such) misunderstood my request and brought out a plate of rock-hard chicken tender-looking things with dried out, stringy white meat inside and a pile of underdone, whitish, mealy fries."
2,3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,1,Even the GMO corn syrup-laden pseudo-ketchup didn't help.
2,3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,1,"The waitress was polite enough, but obviously over worked as she was serving at tables and behind the bar, then apparently forgot I was there and I had to stand up and leave the table to get her attention."
2,3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,1,All I wanted to do was pay and get out of there.
2,3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,1,"The ""hostess"" intervened and asked what I wanted."
2,3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,1,I said all I want is the check and to leave.
2,3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,1,She took that as an insult and accused me of yelling at her.
2,3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,1,"Seriously, I did not yell at her."
2,3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,1,She obviously was having a bad day.
2,3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,1,"I pointed out that I was aware they are understaffed, as is every restaurant in the country...still, not my fault."
2,3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,1,$15 to $20 for a plate of ...whatever...
2,3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,1,I expect a little better quality and service.
2,3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,1," That said, not a nice experience and not a clean environment."
3,P2vwgdFSB8EFUAOOBBj_dQ,4,I figured I would try BurgerPalace again since it's been quite a while since I went and got sick from their food.
3,P2vwgdFSB8EFUAOOBBj_dQ,4,Yesterday I ordered the salad bar and I loved it!
3,P2vwgdFSB8EFUAOOBBj_dQ,4,Our waitress was super nice too!!
3,P2vwgdFSB8EFUAOOBBj_dQ,4,"The restaurant was clean, everything was fresh and my friend and I just had a nice experience."
3,P2vwgdFSB8EFUAOOBBj_dQ,4,The bathroom was even clean which I was really surprised by!!
3,P2vwgdFSB8EFUAOOBBj_dQ,4,I will say the salad bar is definitely not worth $15 though.
3,P2vwgdFSB8EFUAOOBBj_dQ,4,"I suggest ordering a meal and adding the salad bar to it, and you can just take your meal home with you."
3,P2vwgdFSB8EFUAOOBBj_dQ,4,It actually can be cheaper and you get more for your money.
3,P2vwgdFSB8EFUAOOBBj_dQ,4,I will be back for sure!!

5,3h2L6uxUjK3sJr94B_-Scw,1,Service was less than good and the sandwiches we ordered came out warmish.
5,3h2L6uxUjK3sJr94B_-Scw,1,We wanted dessert but she just came out straight with the check without asking smh.
5,3h2L6uxUjK3sJr94B_-Scw,1,Dont go here unless you're old af cause servers here apparently dont like customers that are under 30 years for whatever reason.
5,3h2L6uxUjK3sJr94B_-Scw,1,The server's name was kristi by the way
6,_O-m9ZSxSLa5ze0ZG4IAjw,4,I have always liked eating at BurgerPalace but I was a bit disappointed w/the blackened fish sandwich.
6,_O-m9ZSxSLa5ze0ZG4IAjw,4,It tasted a bit on the frozen side.
6,_O-m9ZSxSLa5ze0ZG4IAjw,4,I will definitely come by again but will stay away from the fish.
7,Mw0zi8GjswSQQsiI-m2bTQ,1,When your order comes out five times incorrectly there's a problem.
7,Mw0zi8GjswSQQsiI-m2bTQ,1,When your order comes out five time correctly and the fries are cold every time that's a problem when you order drinks and wait 13 minutes for a lemonade a seltzer and a Diet Coke and that's a problem when you try to pay for your bill but can't find your waitress for 10 minutes that's a problem.
7,Mw0zi8GjswSQQsiI-m2bTQ,1,I was fortunate enough to meet the owner of this establishment a few years ago I don't think he owns it anymore because it has taken such a dive.
7,Mw0zi8GjswSQQsiI-m2bTQ,1,Everything was awful even the lemonade.
7,Mw0zi8GjswSQQsiI-m2bTQ,1,No manager came over to apologize.
7,Mw0zi8GjswSQQsiI-m2bTQ,1,And I almost forgot the flies.
8,nZ2TxmQzbnutfEtMGx5UOA,1,I went in requestong a table for 2 and they told me they had stopped seating at 8:30 so I ordered to go food then while waiting for my food a family of 6 came in and they seated them immediately.
8,nZ2TxmQzbnutfEtMGx5UOA,1, What kind of racist B.S. is this???
8,nZ2TxmQzbnutfEtMGx5UOA,1, I'm Latina and the family was white.
8,nZ2TxmQzbnutfEtMGx5UOA,1,NEVER AGAIN!!!!  KEEP YOUR FAMILY AWAY FROM THEM.
9,zHkHOnEGKN3mg7LOCUu9jw,2,"Ordered a cobb salad take-out, and a coworker picked it up."
9,zHkHOnEGKN3mg7LOCUu9jw,2,"  It came with no egg, and it was all crappy iceberg lettuce."
9,zHkHOnEGKN3mg7LOCUu9jw,2," Dressing was so thinned out, it was like pouring milk onto the salad."
9,zHkHOnEGKN3mg7LOCUu9jw,2," For $12.99, I expected better."
9,zHkHOnEGKN3mg7LOCUu9jw,2, Won't be back.
10,xTy_AzXy-6veQ4H1YaAKpQ,2,Skip the turkey burger.
10,xTy_AzXy-6veQ4H1YaAKpQ,2,Definitely came from a box.
10,xTy_AzXy-6veQ4H1YaAKpQ,2,Unidentifiable as turkey or a burger.
10,xTy_AzXy-6veQ4H1YaAKpQ,2,Service was ok.
11,K5OdZqTTovq5FDpJ2hHkaw,1,"Unfortunately this restaurant closed in November, 2020."
11,K5OdZqTTovq5FDpJ2hHkaw,1,The only remaining BurgerPalace in Massachusetts is the Wrentham location.
12,4LbWuFSI-kgMM82bPrq3Fw,1,BurgerPalace on a Sunday evening.
12,4LbWuFSI-kgMM82bPrq3Fw,1,At 5.20 we called in an order for take out.
12,4LbWuFSI-kgMM82bPrq3Fw,1,They said 25 to 30 minutes.
12,4LbWuFSI-kgMM82bPrq3Fw,1,No problem.
12,4LbWuFSI-kgMM82bPrq3Fw,1,I got there 28 minutes after placing the order.
12,4LbWuFSI-kgMM82bPrq3Fw,1,There are only 4 cars in the parking lot.
12,4LbWuFSI-kgMM82bPrq3Fw,1,I am one of two cars waiting for pickup.
12,4LbWuFSI-kgMM82bPrq3Fw,1,A guy came out and took my money but the food is not ready yet.
12,4LbWuFSI-kgMM82bPrq3Fw,1,A little while he said. ...
12,4LbWuFSI-kgMM82bPrq3Fw,1,It's now been a 35 minutes of sitting in the parking lot and still no food.
12,4LbWuFSI-kgMM82bPrq3Fw,1,It is hard to imagine there is a valid reason for this.
12,4LbWuFSI-kgMM82bPrq3Fw,1,We stopped dining in when the salad bar closed.
12,4LbWuFSI-kgMM82bPrq3Fw,1,There's not a chance we'll order take out here again.
12,4LbWuFSI-kgMM82bPrq3Fw,1,Update 40 minute total wait in parking lot.
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,If I could give zero stars I would.
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,Do not go here!
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,Horrible in so many ways!
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,Visited on a quiet Tuesday night.
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,My friend waited in entrance for ten minutes waiting to be seated.
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,No staff to be seen.
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,She had to go to the bar and ask someone to seat us.
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,Ordered our dinner.
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,My daughter asked for a side of mashed potatoes it was gross but the smallest portion then charged us $3.99!
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,My daughters friend ordered artichoke dip with endless tortilla chips.
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,Ran out of chips so asked for more.
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,Literally ten minutes later the waitress came out with a super small bowl that literally had five chips in it?
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,Was this a joke?
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,Not funny!
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,Skimpy and that's just ridiculous!
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,My friend ordered a glass of wine.
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,She received before meal but it was bad so she went to the bartender and asked for a new glass.
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,Bartender said they would bring to table.
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,Wine never showed.
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,So after our meal was done she told waitress never mind on the wine.
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,She had no clue?
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,Then they charged her for the wine when we got the bill?
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,Had to ask to take it off.
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,My meal was a quesadilla.
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,Got home within an hour and food poisoning!
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,So sick!
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,This place needs undercover Boss to come in and help them in so many ways!
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,I will never go to a BurgerPalace again.
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,Absolutely nothing good to say.
13,hCfgWPMbh5ypKOUCgi8hCw,1,Keep on driving by and go to any other place but this!
14,vIF6IToLEb1MliVHyHSypQ,1,My family and I came in on a Monday evening.
14,vIF6IToLEb1MliVHyHSypQ,1,There were 6 of us and we were the only customers in the restaurant.
14,vIF6IToLEb1MliVHyHSypQ,1,It took about 20 minutes for us to get some water and about an additional 20 minutes to get our alcoholic beverages.
14,vIF6IToLEb1MliVHyHSypQ,1,The salad was soggy and the bowl was filled with brown water.
14,vIF6IToLEb1MliVHyHSypQ,1,The tilapia was extremely fishy we had to send it back.
14,vIF6IToLEb1MliVHyHSypQ,1,The service was extremely slow.
14,vIF6IToLEb1MliVHyHSypQ,1,We will not be coming back to this establishment.
15,sLCLgiWDMgKC25LHCLqlSg,2,This actually used to be one of our favorite places to go for a good and inexpensive meal.
15,sLCLgiWDMgKC25LHCLqlSg,2,The salad bar alone drew us back again and again for a fresh and healthy meal.
15,sLCLgiWDMgKC25LHCLqlSg,2,This place has gone totally downhill.
15,sLCLgiWDMgKC25LHCLqlSg,2,"Repeatedly our favorite the garden bar has been poorly stocked, not fresh, missing items, and a complete untidy mess."
15,sLCLgiWDMgKC25LHCLqlSg,2,Tonight we stopped in for a couple of burgers.
15,sLCLgiWDMgKC25LHCLqlSg,2,"The restaurant was uncrowded, but we sat there for over half an hour after putting in our order until our meals finally arrived, and when they did the fries were cold."
15,sLCLgiWDMgKC25LHCLqlSg,2,"Our waitress did get us a new plate of fries (and they were excellent, hot and fresh)."
15,sLCLgiWDMgKC25LHCLqlSg,2,"At no point did she or anyone else inform us while waiting that there was a delay, apologize for the delay, ask how the rest of the meal was, or apologize about the cold fries."
15,sLCLgiWDMgKC25LHCLqlSg,2,"Back in ancient history when we enjoyed eating here, if there was a problem we'd see a manager come up and express concern, even offer some compensation such as a complimentary desert, but a manager was nowhere to be seen tonight."
15,sLCLgiWDMgKC25LHCLqlSg,2,"And that, likely, is the root of the problem."
15,sLCLgiWDMgKC25LHCLqlSg,2,"Either no one is watching the store, or they just don't care."
15,sLCLgiWDMgKC25LHCLqlSg,2,It shows.
16,1GXfM3UcEs8OneG1lf4MlA,1,Does not even deserve a one star.
16,1GXfM3UcEs8OneG1lf4MlA,1,Service was horrible salad bar was disgusting the tea looked like beer.
16,1GXfM3UcEs8OneG1lf4MlA,1,We just walked out.
16,1GXfM3UcEs8OneG1lf4MlA,1,Ironic thing was another couple walked out as well at the same time.
16,1GXfM3UcEs8OneG1lf4MlA,1,It would be different if the employees actually cared and we're trying to fix the salad bar or wait on us but we had been there for a long time before we ever even got asked what we wanted to drink.
16,1GXfM3UcEs8OneG1lf4MlA,1,Management was horrible!
16,1GXfM3UcEs8OneG1lf4MlA,1,They were not busy and didn't appear to be understaffed due to the employees standing around just talking.
17,_D3Yvrjlpajt8eUZQ_RgWw,4,Stopped here on our way home from vacation and was not disappointed.
17,_D3Yvrjlpajt8eUZQ_RgWw,4,We were greeted and seated right away.
17,_D3Yvrjlpajt8eUZQ_RgWw,4,Our waitress was friendly and took care of us throughout our time there.
17,_D3Yvrjlpajt8eUZQ_RgWw,4,One thing I want to mention that I found very nice is that since there's currently a shortage on feminine products they were kind enough to supply them in the stalls of the women's bathroom.
17,_D3Yvrjlpajt8eUZQ_RgWw,4,It's the first time I've seen this and was pleasantly surprised.
17,_D3Yvrjlpajt8eUZQ_RgWw,4,I ordered the sampler for lunch and enjoyed it.
17,_D3Yvrjlpajt8eUZQ_RgWw,4,The plates all came out hot and very tasty.
17,_D3Yvrjlpajt8eUZQ_RgWw,4,If you like American food you can't go wrong with this place.
18,w8IkjL6Y6WMoZXsMhIy0vQ,1,Called ahead for a party of 8.
18,w8IkjL6Y6WMoZXsMhIy0vQ,1,No problem.
18,w8IkjL6Y6WMoZXsMhIy0vQ,1,Arrived to a mostly empty house.
18,w8IkjL6Y6WMoZXsMhIy0vQ,1,We left after an hour when our meals were not delivered and my drink had been empty for 25 mins.
19,e3oGMnICb5pLZpGdegFpXA,4,They serve us in the very best way every Tuesday.
19,e3oGMnICb5pLZpGdegFpXA,4,They are very special people....
19,e3oGMnICb5pLZpGdegFpXA,4,  Food is fine!
19,e3oGMnICb5pLZpGdegFpXA,4, I like burgers and salad!
20,pqOv8LapJe_0pU1G18_A1Q,1,I usually don't complain but my experience here was awful.
20,pqOv8LapJe_0pU1G18_A1Q,1,"We got our appetizer before our drinks, the waitress kept disappearing, she would say that she's going to refill our drinks and then disappear for upwards of ten minutes and then serve the tables next to us then refill our drinks, my wife asked for A-1 sauce and was given an empty bottle"
20,pqOv8LapJe_0pU1G18_A1Q,1,", when we were done the table next to us asked for A-1 so the waitress came to our table and said I'm taking this, my wife replied that it was empty when she got it, we waited about 20 minutes to get our bill after we were done, all in all it took about an hour and a half to complete our dinner."
20,pqOv8LapJe_0pU1G18_A1Q,1,I received this comment below so I sent 3 emails per their instructions and it's been days and haven't heard anything.
20,pqOv8LapJe_0pU1G18_A1Q,1,"Update, I sent the email to the address they provided below and it's been a week with no response so maybe they just post this to make themselves look redeemed with no actual follow through??"
21,BZyxkWGOvR-mRVHywlkpoA,4,Besides a longer wait than I would of liked I understand there is a major staff shortage basically everywhere across the country.
21,BZyxkWGOvR-mRVHywlkpoA,4,"The food was good, they took good precautions to keep things clean and sanitary, and despite the wait the staff was friendly and courteous."
22,P3gQXqXJPIrbDoGQCcqghQ,1,Such a poor experience.
22,P3gQXqXJPIrbDoGQCcqghQ,1,"Asked for Burger, no onion-Yup had onion."
22,P3gQXqXJPIrbDoGQCcqghQ,1,"Ordered a loaded bake potato-served french friesSmall item, asked for lemon with my water, no lemon ("
22,P3gQXqXJPIrbDoGQCcqghQ,1,no biggie).Just
22,P3gQXqXJPIrbDoGQCcqghQ,1,"because, I requested the one dollar for the ""loaded"" part of the baked potato to be removed."
22,P3gQXqXJPIrbDoGQCcqghQ,1, A manager was required to delete the dollar.
22,P3gQXqXJPIrbDoGQCcqghQ,1," He came over...so I showed him the Onion, Fries and water without."
22,P3gQXqXJPIrbDoGQCcqghQ,1, His reply was a judging laugh.
22,P3gQXqXJPIrbDoGQCcqghQ,1,Ruby Tuesday management-you have work to do.
22,P3gQXqXJPIrbDoGQCcqghQ,1,My suggestion-go to the Sheetz across the street!
23,nBUMyWkFdEVVdPH5tjGnRg,4,This is certainly one of the better BurgerPalace the salad bar was really well maintained with many choices that were fresh.
23,nBUMyWkFdEVVdPH5tjGnRg,4,We both had a steak special which was cooked correctly and had a nice flavor.
23,nBUMyWkFdEVVdPH5tjGnRg,4,Our server was outstanding.
24,wqDZMcThiwUrJCnIs3vYKg,4,Due to Covid 19 this location had just opened when we were there.
24,wqDZMcThiwUrJCnIs3vYKg,4,It was almost 2 hours to get seated and food.
24,wqDZMcThiwUrJCnIs3vYKg,4,That said they are trying so hard.
24,wqDZMcThiwUrJCnIs3vYKg,4,Be patient.
24,wqDZMcThiwUrJCnIs3vYKg,4,The staff was very friendly and tried hard to accommodate!
24,wqDZMcThiwUrJCnIs3vYKg,4,The manager was hustling and went to every table to see how they were.
24,wqDZMcThiwUrJCnIs3vYKg,4,"To me any negative comments would be due to circumstances beyond their control, so I have none."
25,Syo3joC0zQ94tazngZcCwg,4,We ordered Hickory Bourbon Salmon and it was very good and tender.
25,Syo3joC0zQ94tazngZcCwg,4,It was a pick up order and everything was according to our instructions.
26,No7RENe66pcXWKXdq4_R3A,3,The food was good but we ordered online and the website said it would be ready in 15 minutes and it was 45 minutes before we got it (we picked it ip).
26,No7RENe66pcXWKXdq4_R3A,3,"Also, the kids' meals come with a drink which the website makes you chose (it doesn't let you continue until you chose something) and we didn't get them."
27,LMXhzEWP3eqJVTqkzJtH9A,5,"I have gluten-intolerance, did not expect anything more than a salad when going there by myself due to a flight overnight delay."
27,LMXhzEWP3eqJVTqkzJtH9A,5,"It was a surprise that staff, Dana, has very good knowledge about gluten-intolerance."
27,LMXhzEWP3eqJVTqkzJtH9A,5,"She let me know that they have a gluten-free menu online, and sat down with me helped me craft a burger, no bun+garden salad."
27,LMXhzEWP3eqJVTqkzJtH9A,5,"On top of it, she made sure the burger would be grilled separately on new foil."
27,LMXhzEWP3eqJVTqkzJtH9A,5,This is the first safe burger after I went complete gluten-free.
27,LMXhzEWP3eqJVTqkzJtH9A,5,Of course I loved it!
27,LMXhzEWP3eqJVTqkzJtH9A,5,Really appreciate Dana and the chef's help :)
28,skzogvbpti5FSNsJ4Tanfg,4,"Food was good, waiter was friendly, everything came out at a decent time, only complaint was my burger was slightly undercooked for my liking, yet was still very tastyEdit: cookie skillet is the best dessert i have ever had"
29,vr-HDwRltiddgGf26djH7g,4,The hickory bourbon salmon is amazing and the service is top notch.
29,vr-HDwRltiddgGf26djH7g,4,Ask to sit in Thomas' section.
29,vr-HDwRltiddgGf26djH7g,4,He goes above and beyond.
30,3cauiAM4gWgdXb8lgVIkYw,5,Went for lunch with my daughter and grandson.
30,3cauiAM4gWgdXb8lgVIkYw,5,The food was great and wonderful server named Erin
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2,Where do I begin?
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2," It's a Saturday night, we walk into the restaurant and we aren't even acknowledged for about 4-5 minutes."
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2, They were not busy at all surprisingly.
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2," When we asked if we could have a table for two the person seating us said ""yeah"".  "
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2,She then walks us to a dirty table (mind you there were tons of clean tables) that has one chair.
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2," She says ""hold on while I get you a chair, oh and I'll have to wipe the table.""   We asked if we could just have one of the clean tables."
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2, She seemed surprised but she did let of have a booth.
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2, 
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2,Mind you my girlfriend has to walk with a cane after a knee operation.
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2, We finally get seated and the waitress passes us by about 7 times before coming to our table and asking if we were ready to order.
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2, We were not offered drinks.
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2, We order our food and drinks at the same time.
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2, The waitress then says she will get our drinks right away.
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2, She walks off.
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2," About 10 minutes later, still no drinks."
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2, So I walk over to where she is.
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2, She is sitting at the table counting her tips.  I agin request our drinks.
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2, She finally brings them over and starts talking about how they are short staffed.
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2,(Isn't everyone these days?)
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2,  I am not sure how that applies to her forgetting our drinks.
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2, So now she goes on and talks about how she is a school teacher that lost her job during the pandemic but has worked at the restaurant for a while.
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2,  She goes on about all of the lazy kids they are hiring.
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2, She then said her daughter works there but isn't one of the lazy ones.
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2,We finally get our food.
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2, The food was actually very good and it is the only reason I didn't give one star.
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2," While we were eating, and elderly couple near us requested that the blinds be closed because the sun was shining right in."
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2, They close the blinds.
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2, The waitress (same as ours) comes back and starts telling the lady that they had to argue with a customer sitting near the window who wanted to look out.
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2, Why on Earth would you come back and tell the lady that?  Handle that stuff in-house.
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2, Now the lady feels bad.
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2,"So after about 30 minutes, we finally get refills and the check dropped off."
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2, 
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2,No offer for dessert just the check in the table.
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2,It takes her about 15 -20 minutes to bring the cash out machine over.
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2, She only did so because I held my card out in front of her as she was walking by.
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2, She had spent that 15-20 minutes gabbing away at a table.
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2, 
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2,As for the interior of the restaurant.
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2, The salad bar (which we did not have) looked old and not very fresh.
31,EDv3EgkZN_pLNDMsw0_9kQ,2, The wooden blinds on the windows are broken in several places.
32,FKqjab6kLaGZRGD1tW8K2w,4,Ordered carry out as dining is closed.
32,FKqjab6kLaGZRGD1tW8K2w,4,Smokey Mountain Chicken with broccoli and grilled asparagas was delicious.
32,FKqjab6kLaGZRGD1tW8K2w,4,Wife said her burger was perfectly done.
32,FKqjab6kLaGZRGD1tW8K2w,4,"Thank you, chef."
33,ioIsWD86tSKDEtjplVmC5A,3,We really enjoy going to BurgerPalace in Canton.
33,ioIsWD86tSKDEtjplVmC5A,3, The staff is very pleasant and the food is good.
33,ioIsWD86tSKDEtjplVmC5A,3," However, they just had a big price increase this week - burgers are about $2 more than they were last week."
33,ioIsWD86tSKDEtjplVmC5A,3, That's just crazy!
33,ioIsWD86tSKDEtjplVmC5A,3, Not sure if we'll eat here as much as we have in the past...
34,dQR6feJ88mMmz--J14w-dA,1,Have never been so disappointed in my life.
34,dQR6feJ88mMmz--J14w-dA,1,We were seated in the bar area our waitress was definitely not a people person.
34,dQR6feJ88mMmz--J14w-dA,1,"We saw her to order our food , deliver our food and for our bill that's it never to check to see how we were doing."
34,dQR6feJ88mMmz--J14w-dA,1,"We got three meals a Brisket Sandwich- dry overcooked brisket my cheese was put on after my sandwich was cut and was unmelted and uncut,  Chicken Tender - overcook to the point they couldn't be eaten fries were over cooked , Bacon Cheese Burger- asked for medium rare with no tomato received a well done burger with a juicy tomato."
34,dQR6feJ88mMmz--J14w-dA,1,On the plus side the fires were cooked perfect just had no flavor.
35,gz-sn_2Q_edjJAlGRwbUzQ,1,"This use to be my go to restaurant with my children after sports , school, etc. always great service and food consistently good."
35,gz-sn_2Q_edjJAlGRwbUzQ,1,Stopped by for a quick lunch with my mother- food barely edible!!
35,gz-sn_2Q_edjJAlGRwbUzQ,1,She ordered shrimp scampi and the oil was dripping off pasta- told waitress .
35,gz-sn_2Q_edjJAlGRwbUzQ,1,"She offered to have another dish made, but it took 45 mins for this dish with a handful of diners, no thank you."
35,gz-sn_2Q_edjJAlGRwbUzQ,1,My mom said she'd just eat the shrimp.
35,gz-sn_2Q_edjJAlGRwbUzQ,1," Waitress came back and said "" I took the pasta off and only charged you for the shrimp "" - ummm ok?"
35,gz-sn_2Q_edjJAlGRwbUzQ,1,So first off- the dish sucked and had she known you were still charging her 8.00 for 3 rubbery shrimp my mom would have said take the entire dish - it was that bad!
35,gz-sn_2Q_edjJAlGRwbUzQ,1,Really??
35,gz-sn_2Q_edjJAlGRwbUzQ,1,I got the garlic parm wings and loaded potato- potato about size of my palm and the wings- over cooked and chewy.
35,gz-sn_2Q_edjJAlGRwbUzQ,1,This all makes me sad- this was one of a few chain restaurants I loved.
35,gz-sn_2Q_edjJAlGRwbUzQ,1,I get staffing and supply shortages- and try to not complain- however this was unacceptable at best.
36,b4zA27-LAIfHoE4BXmb92Q,5,You can still do the salad bar.
36,b4zA27-LAIfHoE4BXmb92Q,5,That with a loaded baked potato makes the best meal for me and don't forget the BurgerPalace Relaxer or 2.
36,b4zA27-LAIfHoE4BXmb92Q,5,But you have to drive to Lisbon CT for it.
36,b4zA27-LAIfHoE4BXmb92Q,5,Well with the trip snd lists of places to shop afterwards.
37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,1,We usually go to Chillis across the street but decided to try here since it had been a while.
37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,1,Big mistake.
37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,1,"We were seated right away, not very busy for a Friday night."
37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,1,Guess that should of clued us in.
37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,1,Started with the bone in buffalo wings app.
37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,1,"They were good, but $12.99 for 8 pieces was a little steep."
37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,1,My wife ordered the Asiago bacon chicken.
37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,1,"The menu described it as TWO chicken breasts, and she received one small piece of chicken, so no leftovers and it was $18.99!"
37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,1,I ordered the 12 oz. Ribeye steak for $22.99 and told the waitress medium.
37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,1,I know she heard me because she read our entire order back to us to confirm..
37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,1,My steak arrived and was well done.
37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,1,Not a trace of pink.
37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,1,The quality of the cut was not too good and I doubt it was a 12 oz.
37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,1,I have had better prime ribs for less.
37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,1,I waited to tell the waitress but she never returned to check on us.
37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,1,So I ate it as cooked.
37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,1,One son had NEW fish and chips.
37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,1,We all agreed the 3 small strips he received looked more like fish sticks or chicken tenders.
37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,1,For $13.99 it was a disappointment.
37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,1,My other sons choice was the smokehouse burger for $12.99.
37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,1,"This was the best value for the money, except he had onion rings instead of fries, and received 5 rings so if youre hungry opt for fries."
37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,1,I waitress was polite but never returned to ask how everything was.
37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,1,Later she dropped off the check without asking if we wanted desert.
37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,1,"Total was $79 before tax and tip, good think we only get waters."
37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,1,I did report this to the corporate website.
37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,1,I will update this review if i hear back from them.
37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,1,"One last note, I heard the guy next to us send back his bbq beef brisket because it was mostly fat."
37,TYKJ-Pzz7uo4RFiaY1HqRQ,1,He opted for a burger.
38,7NL5nTBSA9mkomQG2tVn7Q,1,"Aside from the drugs being done in the parking lot, I was able to observe from my dining seat the individual wrapping the silverware."
38,7NL5nTBSA9mkomQG2tVn7Q,1, This was a gross experience to watch as I decided I don't need my silverware.
38,7NL5nTBSA9mkomQG2tVn7Q,1, No gloves scratched head after texting on her phone (we all know how gross are screens are) and proceeded to wrap silverware....that we use to put their food in our mouth.  Guess there's a reason they're closing locations!
39,nGwT0LjD1MrBgXObKSWWaA,1,This was precovid I was in at this location.
39,nGwT0LjD1MrBgXObKSWWaA,1,Service horrible.
39,nGwT0LjD1MrBgXObKSWWaA,1,Ordered spaghetti squash.
39,nGwT0LjD1MrBgXObKSWWaA,1,It was rotten and they wouldn't comp or give another side.
39,nGwT0LjD1MrBgXObKSWWaA,1,Offered me more squash but it was all made together so anything they would bring me would taste rotten.
39,nGwT0LjD1MrBgXObKSWWaA,1,All they kept saying was we made it this morning.
39,nGwT0LjD1MrBgXObKSWWaA,1,Ok you may have had a rotten squash in the mix because I'm sure that they cook more than one squash a day!
39,nGwT0LjD1MrBgXObKSWWaA,1,Do yourself a favor.
39,nGwT0LjD1MrBgXObKSWWaA,1,Go to a locally owned restaurant and support the locals.
39,nGwT0LjD1MrBgXObKSWWaA,1,I will never step foot in a BurgerPalace again.
40,qOWKCzuZ5w6L3luuBJUzqQ,1,"Went here for lunch, awful service."
40,qOWKCzuZ5w6L3luuBJUzqQ,1,I ordered a burger and asked for medium-rare.
40,qOWKCzuZ5w6L3luuBJUzqQ,1,"I received the burger raw, barely cooked."
40,qOWKCzuZ5w6L3luuBJUzqQ,1,We waited about 10 min for a server to emerge so I could let them know.
40,qOWKCzuZ5w6L3luuBJUzqQ,1,"They didn't even apologize, we had to ask for it to get removed from the check."
40,qOWKCzuZ5w6L3luuBJUzqQ,1,Also the side salad lettuce was all rotten.
40,qOWKCzuZ5w6L3luuBJUzqQ,1,The iced tea was pure sugar as well.
40,qOWKCzuZ5w6L3luuBJUzqQ,1,I do not recommend this place.
40,qOWKCzuZ5w6L3luuBJUzqQ,1,"Very long wait just to get seated and get our drinks as well, considering it was not busy."
41,DR0L3dWMIHYDWI0bUeq9HQ,5,We ordered a catered luncheon from them as part of a Christmas feast for my team.
41,DR0L3dWMIHYDWI0bUeq9HQ,5,We ordered 150 individual boxed meals.
41,DR0L3dWMIHYDWI0bUeq9HQ,5,They were amazing.
41,DR0L3dWMIHYDWI0bUeq9HQ,5,"The delivered on time, exactly as ordered, labeled them and the food was great!"
41,DR0L3dWMIHYDWI0bUeq9HQ,5,"Each meal (we chose 5 varieties each for 3 deliveries) was hot, fresh, and perfectly cooked."
41,DR0L3dWMIHYDWI0bUeq9HQ,5,Our team absolutely loved it.
41,DR0L3dWMIHYDWI0bUeq9HQ,5,We had ordered from FOUR other restaurants over the span of November and December catering and RT was the only one  on point
42,v8wnJ6YK2bWi9Vqtg_dFLQ,1,Terrible service.
42,v8wnJ6YK2bWi9Vqtg_dFLQ,1,I've been here many times and never had an issue.
42,v8wnJ6YK2bWi9Vqtg_dFLQ,1,I decided to order take out from their 'to go' menu.
42,v8wnJ6YK2bWi9Vqtg_dFLQ,1,They advertise 'to go' where they will come out and bring the food to your car but there was no option on the website for this?
42,v8wnJ6YK2bWi9Vqtg_dFLQ,1,I went inside to pick my food up and there was no one at the podium near the door.
42,v8wnJ6YK2bWi9Vqtg_dFLQ,1,I was standing there while a waiter was just hanging out near the salad bar.
42,v8wnJ6YK2bWi9Vqtg_dFLQ,1,He kept staring at me and I was waiting for him to come over and help me.
42,v8wnJ6YK2bWi9Vqtg_dFLQ,1,He never came over.
42,v8wnJ6YK2bWi9Vqtg_dFLQ,1,He starting talking to some people and I was getting aggravated.
42,v8wnJ6YK2bWi9Vqtg_dFLQ,1,Finally a waitress came over and I said I was picking up an order.
42,v8wnJ6YK2bWi9Vqtg_dFLQ,1,"In a snobby tone, she told me I had to pick up my order at the bar."
42,v8wnJ6YK2bWi9Vqtg_dFLQ,1,How was I supposed to know I had to pick the food up at the bar?
42,v8wnJ6YK2bWi9Vqtg_dFLQ,1,She then walked away in a different direction and didn't even walk me to where the bar was.
42,v8wnJ6YK2bWi9Vqtg_dFLQ,1, 
42,v8wnJ6YK2bWi9Vqtg_dFLQ,1,"Don't know what was up with the staff, but they were very rude and seemed to only care about socializing."
42,v8wnJ6YK2bWi9Vqtg_dFLQ,1,I will not be ordering from here again.
42,v8wnJ6YK2bWi9Vqtg_dFLQ,1,You just lost a customer.
43,Yciy7V1DITiO5gM8aXwAEg,4,Usually its not a long wait but today was busy so it we did have a semi long wait.
43,Yciy7V1DITiO5gM8aXwAEg,4,My friend said the breadstick was too salty but his shrimp pasta was good.
43,Yciy7V1DITiO5gM8aXwAEg,4,The hot mess burger was noted to have too much sauce but was super great.
43,Yciy7V1DITiO5gM8aXwAEg,4,Overall the food was amazing.
43,Yciy7V1DITiO5gM8aXwAEg,4,And the dessert definitely didn't disappoint.
43,Yciy7V1DITiO5gM8aXwAEg,4,Everything was delicious and ill of course come back.
44,QXNbc2mbDDd-a1IzTyZ1Pw,1,"Service was trash, waitress was high as hell (I support maryjane use but not when you're on cloud nine staring at the ceiling and I'm hungry)."
44,QXNbc2mbDDd-a1IzTyZ1Pw,1,"Will not go again and would recommend others not to, there's a 5 guys not to far, go to them"
45,81e60qYLYghv5e9EQgs10A,5,My Family and I ate here tonight at BurgerPalace Very Friendly Staff and Waiter (Eladio)Wait time to be seated was less than 5 minutes.
45,81e60qYLYghv5e9EQgs10A,5,"Very clean, neat and reasonable prices."
45,81e60qYLYghv5e9EQgs10A,5,Food was very tasty.
45,81e60qYLYghv5e9EQgs10A,5,I ordered the Turkey burger with a side of Broccoli.
45,81e60qYLYghv5e9EQgs10A,5,Christmas music and relaxing music was playing it was a very nice and relaxing environment.
45,81e60qYLYghv5e9EQgs10A,5,My Mom and Aunt enjoyed themselves as well.
45,81e60qYLYghv5e9EQgs10A,5,Very friendly and peaceful environment.
45,81e60qYLYghv5e9EQgs10A,5,Very roomy seating.
46,pjDzyAdl5ml3lHfSZcmmHw,1,Burger was good but fruit flies were EVERYWHERE!
46,pjDzyAdl5ml3lHfSZcmmHw,1,I mean flying around the open liquor bottles everywhere and everyone thought it was normal.
46,pjDzyAdl5ml3lHfSZcmmHw,1,If I noticed it the staff should never will go back but then again I won't ever be back in this small ass town anyways DISGUSTING!!!!
47,HSItJcWd-H3lB13whdra9Q,1,No wonder they're closing up BurgerPalace
47,HSItJcWd-H3lB13whdra9Q,1,Food suck and to go sucks even more.
47,HSItJcWd-H3lB13whdra9Q,1,Ordered to go 2 of their overpriced cheeseburgers.
47,HSItJcWd-H3lB13whdra9Q,1,I ordered mine medium rare and my Wife ordered hers medium.
47,HSItJcWd-H3lB13whdra9Q,1,  We ordered extra Mayo on them.
47,HSItJcWd-H3lB13whdra9Q,1, We get to where we were going and opened up the bag.
47,HSItJcWd-H3lB13whdra9Q,1,You guessed if.
47,HSItJcWd-H3lB13whdra9Q,1,Not a frigging napkin.
47,HSItJcWd-H3lB13whdra9Q,1,"Also, no utensils either."
47,HSItJcWd-H3lB13whdra9Q,1,So I guess you have to eat with your hands and spread the Mayo on with your fingers and lick your fingers clean.
47,HSItJcWd-H3lB13whdra9Q,1,Than comes the burgers.
47,HSItJcWd-H3lB13whdra9Q,1,Well you guessed it again.
47,HSItJcWd-H3lB13whdra9Q,1,2 burgers that tasted like sawdust they were so dry.
47,HSItJcWd-H3lB13whdra9Q,1,Well done also.
47,HSItJcWd-H3lB13whdra9Q,1,You could hardly swallow the garbage.
47,HSItJcWd-H3lB13whdra9Q,1,I barely ate half and threw it out.
47,HSItJcWd-H3lB13whdra9Q,1,Burger King would have been much better.
47,HSItJcWd-H3lB13whdra9Q,1,We will never again go their.
47,HSItJcWd-H3lB13whdra9Q,1,Their food and service sucks.
48,mb4RU04jAcnnHAuU2qseeA,2,The food was good and reasonably priced.
48,mb4RU04jAcnnHAuU2qseeA,2,The atmosphere was a little off but we will chock that up to the covid regulations about dinning.
48,mb4RU04jAcnnHAuU2qseeA,2,"The reason they did not score high is due to our server ""Star"" with long black hair and a Nike logo interacted with us about 2 times."
48,mb4RU04jAcnnHAuU2qseeA,2,She was dry and did not try to build customer relationships.
48,mb4RU04jAcnnHAuU2qseeA,2,It was clear with the regulars or people that she knew she were personable and would talk to them but with new people it seemed to be an inconvenience or almost beneath her.
48,mb4RU04jAcnnHAuU2qseeA,2,She took our drink order and our food order.
48,mb4RU04jAcnnHAuU2qseeA,2,Had another server drop our food off.
48,mb4RU04jAcnnHAuU2qseeA,2,Then we didn't see her again until the end of our meal when she asked about dessert and dropped out tab off.
48,mb4RU04jAcnnHAuU2qseeA,2,"We then waited an additional 10-15 minutes to where we witnessed another Ginger/red hair worker clearing tables, seating people, cashing people out, and cleaning bathrooms while our server was no where in the dining area."
48,mb4RU04jAcnnHAuU2qseeA,2,"Over all the food was good and enjoyable, but the way the server treats customers was uncomfortable and unfriendly."
48,mb4RU04jAcnnHAuU2qseeA,2,Recommend putting this as a take out place and not an actual sit down dining experience.
49,h48h6tsqcmSYmB4oTsh76w,1,Will never be going back here again!
49,h48h6tsqcmSYmB4oTsh76w,1,The kitchen forgot about my dinner then when it finally came out I got food poisoning from it!
49,h48h6tsqcmSYmB4oTsh76w,1,Was so sick couldn't even make it 15 min from the restaurant!
49,h48h6tsqcmSYmB4oTsh76w,1,Do not recommend
50,H-wyPvJkCkvQLdvO3YnrYQ,5,Good food and excellent broccoli.
50,H-wyPvJkCkvQLdvO3YnrYQ,5,Good service and food is delicious.
50,H-wyPvJkCkvQLdvO3YnrYQ,5,Very delightful with great service.
51,j5llUKeh4cC5CpmXOEnM7g,1,Don't fall for the BS!
51,j5llUKeh4cC5CpmXOEnM7g,1,I left vm for the area supervisor about this visit.
51,j5llUKeh4cC5CpmXOEnM7g,1, 
51,j5llUKeh4cC5CpmXOEnM7g,1,Never heard anything from them?Followed direction to email:guestrelations@rubytuesd...With all the information about my visit.
51,j5llUKeh4cC5CpmXOEnM7g,1,Never heard anything from them?Notice
51,j5llUKeh4cC5CpmXOEnM7g,1,they comment how disappointed they are but never actually do anything to fix it.
51,j5llUKeh4cC5CpmXOEnM7g,1,They still don't have hairnets over their beards?
52,fT8Xm3f8gWCsY79xA1gCaA,1,BurgerPalace in Oswego is disgusting  walked in walked out smelled nasty dirty stay far away...
53,Dh9hwV8L7Oq-TyFZUuYYNg,1,"I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and when it got there my waitress told me there was no mustard so I simply wanted something else on the menu and they refused to make it with out me paying for it because ""there's no reason they should have to pay for it"" my waitress was extremely rude (her name was summer) and my friend that I took to dinner with me ask for a medium rare ribeye stake and they came out with a well done steak that was mostly fat when I say mostly I mean 80% at the very least."
53,Dh9hwV8L7Oq-TyFZUuYYNg,1,"Extremely unsatisfied with my food, service was unacceptable not to mention my drink was filled one time the whole hour I was in the restaurant and when I got there it was a 30min wait when there were multiple open tables"
54,WhyazVodCjMWbe04RY1A6Q,1,My brother ordered a steak medium-rare.
54,WhyazVodCjMWbe04RY1A6Q,1,the steak came with a slight sear and completely raw in the middle.
54,WhyazVodCjMWbe04RY1A6Q,1,"He sent It back, and it came back, a little more seared, but still 50 percent raw."
54,WhyazVodCjMWbe04RY1A6Q,1,"he said he was done, didn't eat the steak."
54,WhyazVodCjMWbe04RY1A6Q,1,he ate his sides.
54,WhyazVodCjMWbe04RY1A6Q,1,we got a 10 percent discount on each item.
54,WhyazVodCjMWbe04RY1A6Q,1,"came out to about 5 dollars discount, meaning he got charged 12 dollars for some zucchini and potatoes and ruined dinner."
54,WhyazVodCjMWbe04RY1A6Q,1,"If I was the owner, I'd be so embarrassed that the steak was messed up twice, and I'd completely refund both meals."
54,WhyazVodCjMWbe04RY1A6Q,1,Go to Red Sun and get a great meal reasonably priced.
55,8t1M76ho2GMLhf1Rijajvw,1,Came in around 1 and was told that just me by myself would be a 45 min wait.
55,8t1M76ho2GMLhf1Rijajvw,1,I noticed 1 other party of 3 waiting and no one standing outside.
55,8t1M76ho2GMLhf1Rijajvw,1,"Less than half the tables were taken, so I'm thinking that i was told that since I was the only white person in sight."
55,8t1M76ho2GMLhf1Rijajvw,1,"Can't ever know for sure, but that"
55,8t1M76ho2GMLhf1Rijajvw,1,s what the puzzle pieces look like to me.
55,8t1M76ho2GMLhf1Rijajvw,1,Won't be returning.
56,UTPJ7cryPwR1i9oYbVULhw,2,"Stood in the Lobby all while the servers walked right by us, as if we weren't even there, I asked if we could be seated and the server seemed surprised, as if we had been spoke to, Really?"
56,UTPJ7cryPwR1i9oYbVULhw,2,"Then she said it would be a 30 to an hour wait until the kitchen caught  up, Excuse me,?"
56,UTPJ7cryPwR1i9oYbVULhw,2,It is the managers duty to make sure everyone is on board for the Holiday.
57,l2WK6M7VrB8zCbktcHn-0A,1,Sat down and waited 30 minutes.
57,l2WK6M7VrB8zCbktcHn-0A,1, There were only 5 tables seated in the whole restaurant.
57,l2WK6M7VrB8zCbktcHn-0A,1, Waitress never came to my table.
57,l2WK6M7VrB8zCbktcHn-0A,1, Staff just kept ignoring my table even though they knew we were waiting.
57,l2WK6M7VrB8zCbktcHn-0A,1,  They were super attentive to the black customers to the point of walking past us repeatedly to help them while still ignoring us.
57,l2WK6M7VrB8zCbktcHn-0A,1, The staff is racist against white people.
57,l2WK6M7VrB8zCbktcHn-0A,1, Ended up walking out.
57,l2WK6M7VrB8zCbktcHn-0A,1, Never going to this racist place again.
58,CrwLQzyFaYs0xjfmMJbWNg,5,Shout out to Karen!
58,CrwLQzyFaYs0xjfmMJbWNg,5,Greatest waitperson ever!
58,CrwLQzyFaYs0xjfmMJbWNg,5,And the food at this location is always good.
58,CrwLQzyFaYs0xjfmMJbWNg,5,Salad bar is always fresh.
58,CrwLQzyFaYs0xjfmMJbWNg,5,My baked potato was cooked just right and the ribs are the best I've had outside of a bbq joint.
58,CrwLQzyFaYs0xjfmMJbWNg,5,I recommend this place highly.
58,CrwLQzyFaYs0xjfmMJbWNg,5,And ask for Karen if you want an extra fun meal.
59,l_lELd5W9z_0BLeGfpkURQ,1,Walked in and was seated at the bar counter as I requested.
59,l_lELd5W9z_0BLeGfpkURQ,1, 
59,l_lELd5W9z_0BLeGfpkURQ,1,"Was staying at a hotel across the street, and I was tired but hungry, so decided to have a quick dinner there."
59,l_lELd5W9z_0BLeGfpkURQ,1,"For 15 minutes, I sat there unable to get the waiters to come take my order."
59,l_lELd5W9z_0BLeGfpkURQ,1, Eye contact attempts and my raised hand were  deliberately avoided and/or ignored.  
59,l_lELd5W9z_0BLeGfpkURQ,1,I did actually caught attention of one of the waiters but he decided it was time to turn around and go busy himself with something else other than attending my needs which I was ready to pay for and tip.
59,l_lELd5W9z_0BLeGfpkURQ,1, 
59,l_lELd5W9z_0BLeGfpkURQ,1,Walked out without anyone saying a word to me and ended up driving elsewhere for food.
59,l_lELd5W9z_0BLeGfpkURQ,1,"  No, I wasn't stinking bad or wearing Speedo or anything that made me unapproachable."
59,l_lELd5W9z_0BLeGfpkURQ,1, we see so many social media posts about people not tipping waiters right nowadays and there is a BurgerPalace with waiters who just complete ignore your existence.
59,l_lELd5W9z_0BLeGfpkURQ,1, 
59,l_lELd5W9z_0BLeGfpkURQ,1,Shame.
60,ee-0zU7hhLaJkFddv4J5yg,5,Food was awesome.
60,ee-0zU7hhLaJkFddv4J5yg,5,I had the Smokey mountain chicken and hubby had the chicken  fajitas.
60,ee-0zU7hhLaJkFddv4J5yg,5,Salad bar was amazing as always.
60,ee-0zU7hhLaJkFddv4J5yg,5,Tony was our server and was super friendly and upbeat.
60,ee-0zU7hhLaJkFddv4J5yg,5,We will ask for him next time!
61,ppXfnykEmUQi1WMLayQeMw,1,"Way overpriced for frozen dinner grade food, much like Millstone."
61,ppXfnykEmUQi1WMLayQeMw,1,Salad bar is a downgraded version of what you get at most BurgerPalace They are know for their salad bar and here it's about 1/3 the size.
61,ppXfnykEmUQi1WMLayQeMw,1,Ordered chicken strip and salad bar and chicken strip took 45 minutes and they were burnt.
61,ppXfnykEmUQi1WMLayQeMw,1,Made her take them off the bill and just paid for my salad.
62,FKz8V7BaqrmxHAmoBzPGTA,3,RT is a chain so there's no menu surprises.
62,FKz8V7BaqrmxHAmoBzPGTA,3,Very few customers at 1:15.
62,FKz8V7BaqrmxHAmoBzPGTA,3,"The one waiter, Austin,  had all the area, bussed the tables then greeted and sat three more guest tables."
62,FKz8V7BaqrmxHAmoBzPGTA,3,I had the salad bar which is a full selection table.
62,FKz8V7BaqrmxHAmoBzPGTA,3, 
62,FKz8V7BaqrmxHAmoBzPGTA,3,More than enough to fill me.
62,FKz8V7BaqrmxHAmoBzPGTA,3,My husband ordered fish and chips.
62,FKz8V7BaqrmxHAmoBzPGTA,3,When it came there was no tartar sauce.
62,FKz8V7BaqrmxHAmoBzPGTA,3,The server didn't mention that as he would have made a different choice.
62,FKz8V7BaqrmxHAmoBzPGTA,3,He did bring Mayo when we requested it.
62,FKz8V7BaqrmxHAmoBzPGTA,3,While service was slow I understood Austin had to serve everyone.
63,eGNpER7nJKvIazwliaLoBg,1,The waiter was not reliable.
63,eGNpER7nJKvIazwliaLoBg,1,They messed up my order twice.
63,eGNpER7nJKvIazwliaLoBg,1,My girlfriend found a really big piece of plastic in her food.
63,eGNpER7nJKvIazwliaLoBg,1,I told the waiter and he just said oh and went on with his day.
63,eGNpER7nJKvIazwliaLoBg,1,My sisters salmon was very undercooked.
63,eGNpER7nJKvIazwliaLoBg,1,I also told the waiter about this and he did nothing.
63,eGNpER7nJKvIazwliaLoBg,1,He said sorry and that was it.
63,eGNpER7nJKvIazwliaLoBg,1,He didn't offer to replace it or for a free meal.
63,eGNpER7nJKvIazwliaLoBg,1,I had to catch the manager when he was walking by and he offered a free desert.
63,eGNpER7nJKvIazwliaLoBg,1,It's not the ruby Tuesday's I use to know.
63,eGNpER7nJKvIazwliaLoBg,1,I would recommend staying away.
63,eGNpER7nJKvIazwliaLoBg,1,Eat elsewhere.
64,4zZqqRk3n8kCr4PnwTfd2g,1,Got seated promptly and got water and every other person who walked in got service but us!
64,4zZqqRk3n8kCr4PnwTfd2g,1,Waiter knew people at the one table and kept going over to them.
64,4zZqqRk3n8kCr4PnwTfd2g,1,Tried to wave someone over with menus on edge of table meaning we wanted to order.
64,4zZqqRk3n8kCr4PnwTfd2g,1,We left.
64,4zZqqRk3n8kCr4PnwTfd2g,1,Building also was very worn had to much time to look around waiting.
65,s0I0iPBfQFU-CeJ-zWF0Xg,5,This is one of the better places in town to eat.
65,s0I0iPBfQFU-CeJ-zWF0Xg,5,I love the friendly waitstaff and it is always clean.
65,s0I0iPBfQFU-CeJ-zWF0Xg,5,"I have ordered various meals from here and have found consistency which is something most restaurants in Aberdeen, SD struggle with."
65,s0I0iPBfQFU-CeJ-zWF0Xg,5,Love the food and is one of my favorite places to each lunch at.
66,T8cd6kuk_9gZdKFyFAuN9Q,1,We were sat inside on a Saturday night and greeted right away at the door.
66,T8cd6kuk_9gZdKFyFAuN9Q,1,We waited a long time for our server to greet us and saw other servers walking by us.
66,T8cd6kuk_9gZdKFyFAuN9Q,1,"We never saw a server, but what was the biggest turn off was there is no social distanced tables  (we were 12 inches away from other guests), none of the employees or customers wearing masks."
66,T8cd6kuk_9gZdKFyFAuN9Q,1,My mother is in the age range which it could be high risk.
66,T8cd6kuk_9gZdKFyFAuN9Q,1,We decided to leave and found a restaurant that had all employees wearing masks.
66,T8cd6kuk_9gZdKFyFAuN9Q,1,Strange (we thought it was a state thing and all restaurants would be mask free then) that some restaurants seem to care about all of their customers not just a few.
66,T8cd6kuk_9gZdKFyFAuN9Q,1,It was uncomfortable from the beginning.
66,T8cd6kuk_9gZdKFyFAuN9Q,1,I work in a restaurant and wait tables and think it's common courtesy and is a requirement for our servers
67,PoKziwyrfUDFvlJtGNFItw,1,This place is dirty!
67,PoKziwyrfUDFvlJtGNFItw,1,The rugs smell and the food was not that great!
67,PoKziwyrfUDFvlJtGNFItw,1,"The booth we sat in was so dirty with ripped seats and filthy, I don't know why we didn't walk out!Looks"
67,PoKziwyrfUDFvlJtGNFItw,1,like the Paneling hasn't been wiped in years
67,PoKziwyrfUDFvlJtGNFItw,1,!
67,PoKziwyrfUDFvlJtGNFItw,1,Ugh!!
68,o8KKx8sRPlqPcN-2alhWKA,4,I'm just over the moon about the salad bar I like all the fixings and it's consistent no matter where you go in the country BurgerPalace is known for the awesome salad bar and it's always consistently good
69,dl5R0eaG52hJfbpP2HUVHQ,1,Place is going downhill.
69,dl5R0eaG52hJfbpP2HUVHQ,1,Mediocre food.
69,dl5R0eaG52hJfbpP2HUVHQ,1,Depressing atmosphere.
69,dl5R0eaG52hJfbpP2HUVHQ,1,Everything in the place needs a revamping.
70,QnpRWmnz4JBBLDUpY_C4hw,4,We've haven't been here for a long time because we didn't enjoy our last meal (during the pandemic) but we received an email offer for a free entree with one purchase option.
70,QnpRWmnz4JBBLDUpY_C4hw,4,Gave them another chance and glad we did.
70,QnpRWmnz4JBBLDUpY_C4hw,4,The salad bar (they call it a Garden Bar) is back!!!!
70,QnpRWmnz4JBBLDUpY_C4hw,4,That earned 1 1/2 stars.
70,QnpRWmnz4JBBLDUpY_C4hw,4,The food was served hot and fresh and it was very good.
70,QnpRWmnz4JBBLDUpY_C4hw,4,"Our server, Jen, has been there ""forever"" and we also ask for her when we arrive."
70,QnpRWmnz4JBBLDUpY_C4hw,4,"A lot of new staff there, but Jen is still the best!"
70,QnpRWmnz4JBBLDUpY_C4hw,4,"Their hours have changed and they close at 9:00 pm SHARP every night now, so no late night stops at their bar for a drink."
70,QnpRWmnz4JBBLDUpY_C4hw,4,The are also closed for lunch twice a week (Mondays & Thursdays) so dinner 4-9 pm is their standard operating hours.
70,QnpRWmnz4JBBLDUpY_C4hw,4,There was a nice crowd there so people are returning to this restaurant.
70,QnpRWmnz4JBBLDUpY_C4hw,4,We will be back because we enjoy their Garden Bar ($5.99) as this separates them from just another diner or a place like Chili's (yuck!).
71,DeSp5Y-EmDpLNF3sOvDmWQ,2,This used to be my favorite place to go for dinner.
71,DeSp5Y-EmDpLNF3sOvDmWQ,2, They used to have an awesome  salad bar which I always got in order to have a dessert if Iwanted to.
71,DeSp5Y-EmDpLNF3sOvDmWQ,2,We took our daughter there last night for her birthday since she had never been there and wanted the salad bar also.
71,DeSp5Y-EmDpLNF3sOvDmWQ,2," Much to our surprise and disappointment,  there was no salad bar"
71,DeSp5Y-EmDpLNF3sOvDmWQ,2,at all!!The
71,DeSp5Y-EmDpLNF3sOvDmWQ,2,prices were raised a lot and our 5 ounce wine cost $10!
71,DeSp5Y-EmDpLNF3sOvDmWQ,2, I could have bought an entire bottle for that price.
71,DeSp5Y-EmDpLNF3sOvDmWQ,2, Our bill including tip  was $121.
71,DeSp5Y-EmDpLNF3sOvDmWQ,2," For that price we could have gone to Seasons 52, and that is where we will be celebrating important events from now on."
72,NfKuqVyh2GFVu44vx8-v-w,1,The only reason we went here was because we had a gift card.
72,NfKuqVyh2GFVu44vx8-v-w,1,This place needs to be closed.
72,NfKuqVyh2GFVu44vx8-v-w,1,It's dirty and the service was terrible.
72,NfKuqVyh2GFVu44vx8-v-w,1,The food is overly salty.
72,NfKuqVyh2GFVu44vx8-v-w,1,Our food arrived lukewarm and our spinach artichoke dip was greasy and cold.
72,NfKuqVyh2GFVu44vx8-v-w,1,Waitress was inattentive and the hostess was too busy on her cell phone to notice customers were seated and weren't waited on.
72,NfKuqVyh2GFVu44vx8-v-w,1,Don't waste your time and money on this place.
73,CJX1FNYHsHLL4jwc_vvsnQ,3,The food was amazing.
73,CJX1FNYHsHLL4jwc_vvsnQ,3, We started with the shrimp fondue appetizer.
73,CJX1FNYHsHLL4jwc_vvsnQ,3, I had half rack of ribs with tots and broccoli.
73,CJX1FNYHsHLL4jwc_vvsnQ,3, The ribs were done to perfection in their classic bbq sauce.  Falling off the bone and delicious.
73,CJX1FNYHsHLL4jwc_vvsnQ,3, My daughter had the shrimp scampi in a lemon sauce.
73,CJX1FNYHsHLL4jwc_vvsnQ,3,  She too really enjoyed her meal.
73,CJX1FNYHsHLL4jwc_vvsnQ,3, She said the shrimp were amazing but the sauce was a little too lemony.
73,CJX1FNYHsHLL4jwc_vvsnQ,3," Overall, she would order it again because it had a lot of flavor."
73,CJX1FNYHsHLL4jwc_vvsnQ,3,The waiter was subpar.
73,CJX1FNYHsHLL4jwc_vvsnQ,3," He was quick to take our order, but he never approached our table again except to see if we wanted dessert."
73,CJX1FNYHsHLL4jwc_vvsnQ,3, Never asked I'd everything was ok.
73,CJX1FNYHsHLL4jwc_vvsnQ,3, Never asked if we needed refills.
73,CJX1FNYHsHLL4jwc_vvsnQ,3, Not even a check in.
73,CJX1FNYHsHLL4jwc_vvsnQ,3, 
73,CJX1FNYHsHLL4jwc_vvsnQ,3,"If he was overwhelmed by his 4 tables he was serving, fine,  but they were in a row (all booths) so he could easily have checked in while walking by.  Nope."
73,CJX1FNYHsHLL4jwc_vvsnQ,3,Not the case.
73,CJX1FNYHsHLL4jwc_vvsnQ,3, It's a shame because this place deserves 5 stars based on our meal.
73,CJX1FNYHsHLL4jwc_vvsnQ,3," When it was time to pay, he brought over a portable credit card machine and left it on the table and walked away."
73,CJX1FNYHsHLL4jwc_vvsnQ,3, I wanted to pay cash but didn't because I wasn't sure if I was allowed.
73,CJX1FNYHsHLL4jwc_vvsnQ,3, I accidentally hit the wrong button on the machine and had to navigate my way through his other open orders to find mine.
73,CJX1FNYHsHLL4jwc_vvsnQ,3," Oddly, we had the same tab total as another table so if I didnt check it out, their bill would have been paid."
73,CJX1FNYHsHLL4jwc_vvsnQ,3," It's a bad system that allowed me to see other orders, but even worse that he just left the machine for me to do whatever with it."
73,CJX1FNYHsHLL4jwc_vvsnQ,3, Really I have one pet peeve when eating at a restaurant and this is when the server doesn't ask us if everything is OK while we are still eating.
73,CJX1FNYHsHLL4jwc_vvsnQ,3," If you wait until we are done, it's too late."
74,bYNbZF4Bzh2REAsL46dj-A,1,Alway order online from this location.
74,bYNbZF4Bzh2REAsL46dj-A,1,I decided to take my kids out to celebrate their good grades for the end of school year.
74,bYNbZF4Bzh2REAsL46dj-A,1,Happy to finally be in a restaurant.
74,bYNbZF4Bzh2REAsL46dj-A,1,They seated us and we were at our table for 25 minutes without a waiter.
74,bYNbZF4Bzh2REAsL46dj-A,1,The waiters kept passing by us.
74,bYNbZF4Bzh2REAsL46dj-A,1,They truly ignored us.
74,bYNbZF4Bzh2REAsL46dj-A,1, When we got up to leave they proceeded to tell us our waiter was coming.
74,bYNbZF4Bzh2REAsL46dj-A,1,There were two groups of caucasian people that came after us and they were served.
74,bYNbZF4Bzh2REAsL46dj-A,1,Work on your customer service with people of color.
74,bYNbZF4Bzh2REAsL46dj-A,1, Very very disappointing.
75,-uPK9SArgf-4GF23jOPbnQ,1,Nice while it lasted.
75,-uPK9SArgf-4GF23jOPbnQ,1,Post Covid they closed this location.
75,-uPK9SArgf-4GF23jOPbnQ,1,Nearest location is in Mt Laurel NJ..Too far to travel with competitors close by.
75,-uPK9SArgf-4GF23jOPbnQ,1,Shame we enjoyed dining there.
75,-uPK9SArgf-4GF23jOPbnQ,1,"During Covid shut down we did take out, but I guess not enough business to stay open."
76,VaWUq3rZfnA-qm8mz2K24g,5,Patrick is the best server ever!!
76,VaWUq3rZfnA-qm8mz2K24g,5,"He was super polite, respectful, and made sure we had a great experience!"
76,VaWUq3rZfnA-qm8mz2K24g,5,The food was also great!
77,EDkTF1QOzOn0vQDVgEcsZA,2,I will say the wait staff was great!!!
77,EDkTF1QOzOn0vQDVgEcsZA,2, The food however was not very good at all.
77,EDkTF1QOzOn0vQDVgEcsZA,2,I came with my three kids whom are not picky eaters.
77,EDkTF1QOzOn0vQDVgEcsZA,2, My oldest had the nacho appetizer for and entree.
77,EDkTF1QOzOn0vQDVgEcsZA,2,"Not good at all she asked for jalapeños on it, literally got 2 slices."
77,EDkTF1QOzOn0vQDVgEcsZA,2,"My sons ribs were ""ok"" and ""warm""."
77,EDkTF1QOzOn0vQDVgEcsZA,2,My other son's burger was decent.
77,EDkTF1QOzOn0vQDVgEcsZA,2,I had the rib eye.
77,EDkTF1QOzOn0vQDVgEcsZA,2,Way too salty and very thinly cut.
77,EDkTF1QOzOn0vQDVgEcsZA,2,Mushy broccoli.
77,EDkTF1QOzOn0vQDVgEcsZA,2,The mashed potatoes were ok.
77,EDkTF1QOzOn0vQDVgEcsZA,2, Not a very good food experience.
78,Kl_GIVpKy0-n5TO4mpu7lw,5,Great staff.
78,Kl_GIVpKy0-n5TO4mpu7lw,5,Ladies out front wonderful.
78,Kl_GIVpKy0-n5TO4mpu7lw,5,Personable and very accommodating.
78,Kl_GIVpKy0-n5TO4mpu7lw,5,Will be back.
79,rdL7xbXHBzJj08ZZ6tifrQ,1,The past year this place has gone from bad to worse.
79,rdL7xbXHBzJj08ZZ6tifrQ,1,"Dirty dishes, nasty food."
79,rdL7xbXHBzJj08ZZ6tifrQ,1,No manager to complain to this past weekend.
79,rdL7xbXHBzJj08ZZ6tifrQ,1,This is the last time I will ever go there again.
79,rdL7xbXHBzJj08ZZ6tifrQ,1,I complained that my potato was room temp.
79,rdL7xbXHBzJj08ZZ6tifrQ,1,And the waitress said it was because they were trying to clean up and leave.
79,rdL7xbXHBzJj08ZZ6tifrQ,1,She then sat down took off her shoes and socks and picked at her feet.
79,rdL7xbXHBzJj08ZZ6tifrQ,1,"Put her shoes back on, and came back over to our table to refill our tea."
79,rdL7xbXHBzJj08ZZ6tifrQ,1,And she didn't wash her hands.
79,rdL7xbXHBzJj08ZZ6tifrQ,1,What  else can I say.
79,rdL7xbXHBzJj08ZZ6tifrQ,1,Stay away!
80,L5mgChsa9NEH_BpFYe9HJA,1,We called before pulling into the parking lot and were told no wait.
80,L5mgChsa9NEH_BpFYe9HJA,1,"2 minutes later we went in and we're told there would be at least 30 minutes for a table, despite many empty tables."
80,L5mgChsa9NEH_BpFYe9HJA,1,My husband complained to the hostess.
80,L5mgChsa9NEH_BpFYe9HJA,1,A lady that said she was her mother followed us out to the car and opened the driver door and started yelling at us for being rude to her grown daughter.
80,L5mgChsa9NEH_BpFYe9HJA,1,Once we finally got her.
80,L5mgChsa9NEH_BpFYe9HJA,1,"To step away from the door enough to close it, she went and stood behind our vehicle and banged on the back window."
80,L5mgChsa9NEH_BpFYe9HJA,1,She wouldn't move so we could pull out until she saw I was calling the police.
81,3YLRmrQb_NSX9ynFKjFGAg,1,What a mess.
81,3YLRmrQb_NSX9ynFKjFGAg,1,I ordered the chicken quesadilla.
81,3YLRmrQb_NSX9ynFKjFGAg,1,"It was made totally wrong, with tomatoes inside, no bacon or scallions inside, and not served with the pico and sour cream."
81,3YLRmrQb_NSX9ynFKjFGAg,1,It was also tossed on a disposable plate piled on top of each other (each piece like it was thrown on.)
81,3YLRmrQb_NSX9ynFKjFGAg,1,The waitress was great and took it off the bill but did inform me even they said when she took it back it was messed up.
81,3YLRmrQb_NSX9ynFKjFGAg,1,"My daughters sliders, the cheese wasn't melted but were other wise okay and speaking of non melted cheese, check out the ""cheese fries"" also sans scallions covered in what appears to be canned cheese sauce (which tasted gritty like it was old and separating) non melted shredded cheddar and bacon crumbles."
81,3YLRmrQb_NSX9ynFKjFGAg,1,No ranch served like in the menu.
81,3YLRmrQb_NSX9ynFKjFGAg,1,(Also arrived when my mom was finishing up her entree)
81,3YLRmrQb_NSX9ynFKjFGAg,1,"The fries in the kids meals were so bad my two year old was like ""nope"" and he eats old McDonald's off the van floor."
81,3YLRmrQb_NSX9ynFKjFGAg,1,"My mom got the chicken Alfredo, the broccoli was hard and it looked and tasted like it had been microwaved from frozen."
81,3YLRmrQb_NSX9ynFKjFGAg,1, She ate it though because she was starving.
81,3YLRmrQb_NSX9ynFKjFGAg,1,"And said it ""wasn't horrible but not great."
81,3YLRmrQb_NSX9ynFKjFGAg,1,"Don't get me wrong, I don't expect a ton from chains but come on man."
81,3YLRmrQb_NSX9ynFKjFGAg,1,"Again, the waitress was great and  assisted us without complaint (her tip was in no way affected by the back of house travesty) but I don't think we'll be back."
82,BmJGRcGXefHFaD3XR7umIg,4,Difficulty choosing what we wanted for food after our horse event nearby.
82,BmJGRcGXefHFaD3XR7umIg,4,Some of this group has shut down.
82,BmJGRcGXefHFaD3XR7umIg,4,Glad is open here.
82,BmJGRcGXefHFaD3XR7umIg,4,Always been good choice.
82,BmJGRcGXefHFaD3XR7umIg,4,"And this was real good, everything."
82,BmJGRcGXefHFaD3XR7umIg,4,I had the Blackened Shrimp and Sausage Pasta with requested marinara.
82,BmJGRcGXefHFaD3XR7umIg,4,Sure good.
83,aEejuz30K1OHWfYHPL9K6Q,2,Food took well over an hour to come out and then was not good.
83,aEejuz30K1OHWfYHPL9K6Q,2,Giving this 2 stars because the broccoli was strait gas dawg.
84,xAuI0bwUkAfmf3yTlr9Tqg,2,We didn't get waters until after the appetizers came out... but the BurgerPalace Relaxers are gas.
85,zYM2sLgjXyJsp5foIfix-Q,1,I have tried contact guest review BurgerPalace per the response given and aboaoltuely nothing has happened and no further communication has transpired.
86,9IZPv6bso00lVz7obdvMJA,1,My hubby & I decided to try a place we had never eaten at before so we pulled into BurgerPalace as we were driving thru.
86,9IZPv6bso00lVz7obdvMJA,1,I'll never know how good or bad the food was as we were seated & told our server would be with us in a moment.
86,9IZPv6bso00lVz7obdvMJA,1,He must have quit as we were never offered a drink or anything.
86,9IZPv6bso00lVz7obdvMJA,1,There were 3 workers at a table chatting & no one ever helped us.
86,9IZPv6bso00lVz7obdvMJA,1,Fed up we finally left.
86,9IZPv6bso00lVz7obdvMJA,1,"As we walked out the girl said in a cheerful voice, have a nice day."
86,9IZPv6bso00lVz7obdvMJA,1,Really????
86,9IZPv6bso00lVz7obdvMJA,1,Nice would have been doing your job & feeding me.
87,6i0y0-6diaqKuSJlrpobhQ,1,Placed an online pickup order for the advertised BBQ chicken salad.
87,6i0y0-6diaqKuSJlrpobhQ,1,"Upon arrival, I waited in the entrance for close to 10 minutes before any staff even acknowledged my presence, even though 3 different staff members saw me standing there."
87,6i0y0-6diaqKuSJlrpobhQ,1,The salad was quite small for the price AND there was not a speck of chicken on the salad.
87,6i0y0-6diaqKuSJlrpobhQ,1,Very disappointing.
87,6i0y0-6diaqKuSJlrpobhQ,1,I won't ever return.
87,6i0y0-6diaqKuSJlrpobhQ,1,Service and food were bad
88,q6JzgFcqzF6xUkzMJfeWig,4,Went there for lunch while on the road.
88,q6JzgFcqzF6xUkzMJfeWig,4,Really enjoyed the endless soup and salad bar.
88,q6JzgFcqzF6xUkzMJfeWig,4,Our waitress was great .
88,q6JzgFcqzF6xUkzMJfeWig,4,We will be back.
89,WB-EsTmkGVD_HrfRYxH9aw,1,Isn't it funny that there has been no response from management?
89,WB-EsTmkGVD_HrfRYxH9aw,1, That says a lot about their commitment to quality and customer service.
89,WB-EsTmkGVD_HrfRYxH9aw,1,I would advise no one support this establishment.
90,V17rzZ1fvjBbNhS0rZ0fVw,1,Took my father for a nice Father's day lunch on 6/20/21.
90,V17rzZ1fvjBbNhS0rZ0fVw,1," We waited for at least 15 minutes before our server even came to get our drink order; at which time he said ""guess they snuck you in on me"".  There was only 1 other table, (1 person) in the server's area when we were seated and finally placed our order yet we waited over an hour to receive it."
90,V17rzZ1fvjBbNhS0rZ0fVw,1, That was only after I asked our server about it.
90,V17rzZ1fvjBbNhS0rZ0fVw,1, I know that covid has caused a lot of business' to be short handed so we waited patiently.
90,V17rzZ1fvjBbNhS0rZ0fVw,1, Server said he got busy all at once and our order was being prepared.
90,V17rzZ1fvjBbNhS0rZ0fVw,1, The other three tables that came in considerably after we placed our order were finishing their meals and leaving.
90,V17rzZ1fvjBbNhS0rZ0fVw,1, There was not doubt in my mind that he forgot to turn our order in.
90,V17rzZ1fvjBbNhS0rZ0fVw,1," Once we received our order, my father's Asiago Steak & shrimp came with no shrimp and the steak was small and hurriedly cooked."
90,V17rzZ1fvjBbNhS0rZ0fVw,1, We arrived just before 2:00pm and didn't get out of there until 4:25pm.
90,V17rzZ1fvjBbNhS0rZ0fVw,1, The server then presented me with a $51.83 ticket and said I hope we didn't hold you up today.
90,V17rzZ1fvjBbNhS0rZ0fVw,1, No offer to discount or even apologize for what happened.
90,V17rzZ1fvjBbNhS0rZ0fVw,1, I never post negative experiences but I just couldn't let this one go.
90,V17rzZ1fvjBbNhS0rZ0fVw,1,It literally ruin the day for my dad...
90,V17rzZ1fvjBbNhS0rZ0fVw,1, I will not return to this location and at this point may not return to any
91,rkW7aWyM9_Lx3tYeVC-y4Q,1,Went to the BurgerPalace in Springfield Mo next to the Drury Inn..
91,rkW7aWyM9_Lx3tYeVC-y4Q,1,The food was terrible I order a crispy chicken salad and the chicken was burnt there were no crotons and the romaine lettuce was not romaine..
91,rkW7aWyM9_Lx3tYeVC-y4Q,1,We ordered to go..
91,rkW7aWyM9_Lx3tYeVC-y4Q,1,The staff is nice but the food terrible
92,cUccIi5AS39DMUocbiM5zQ,1,Worst BurgerPalace visit ever!!!Ordered a Michelob  Ultra waitress came back 5 min later saying out of Michelob ultra Ordered Salmon..... again another 5 minutes out of SalmonOrdered a steak ordered med-well came out rare Sent back still rare could not chew itHad to ask for drinks 2xMgr didn't seem to careOffered free burgerAVOID AT ALL COSTS
93,6AFswCKHt4XXoT-EUfzPVA,1,"Overpriced, subpar food."
93,6AFswCKHt4XXoT-EUfzPVA,1,"The salad bar was empty, no plates to get your salad."
93,6AFswCKHt4XXoT-EUfzPVA,1,"The wait staff was very slow, and did not seem to have ambition to effectively wait on their customers."
94,AncpvA9shRgGVruwmr1pdg,2,"I need to preface this review to say that I have had great experiences dining at BurgerPalace restaurants over the  years, but today's experience was really, really poor that I felt compelled to write my first restaurant review."
94,AncpvA9shRgGVruwmr1pdg,2,My husband and I decided to use our BurgerPalace gift card.
94,AncpvA9shRgGVruwmr1pdg,2, The restaurant was not busy when we arrived a little past noon.
94,AncpvA9shRgGVruwmr1pdg,2," We were seated right away, but it took awhile for the waiter assigned to our booth to take our drink order (water and iced tea)."
94,AncpvA9shRgGVruwmr1pdg,2, 
94,AncpvA9shRgGVruwmr1pdg,2,Then it took even longer to get the drinks.
94,AncpvA9shRgGVruwmr1pdg,2,"Regarding our food, my husband's meal was fine."
94,AncpvA9shRgGVruwmr1pdg,2," However, the Cole slaw and honey mustard was missing from my chicken tenders meal, which was to be included."
94,AncpvA9shRgGVruwmr1pdg,2," The waiter realized I was missing the items and said he would get them for me, but he never returned."
94,AncpvA9shRgGVruwmr1pdg,2," I waited and waited, but  finally ended up having to go to the salad bar to get the honey mustard dressing."
94,AncpvA9shRgGVruwmr1pdg,2," I also had to get my own set of silverware from the table behind me, as I didn't have any, and had to get the ketchup and extra napkins from the cleaning station located near our booth."
94,AncpvA9shRgGVruwmr1pdg,2,The waiter never returned to our table to see if everything was okay or if we needed refills on our drinks.
94,AncpvA9shRgGVruwmr1pdg,2, I finally had to go to the hostess to ask for another glass of water and iced tea.
94,AncpvA9shRgGVruwmr1pdg,2," Last, but not least, I found a hair on my plate that was not visible until the end of my meal (the French fries had covered it).The"
94,AncpvA9shRgGVruwmr1pdg,2,waiter never returned to give us our bill so we had to track down the hostess to see if she could take our payment for the meal.
94,AncpvA9shRgGVruwmr1pdg,2, Our waiter finally appeared and decided to take care of our payment at that point.
94,AncpvA9shRgGVruwmr1pdg,2," You guessed correctly, we did not leave a tip due to the poor service we received."
94,AncpvA9shRgGVruwmr1pdg,2,Needless to say it will be awhile before we go back to that particular BurgerPalace.
94,AncpvA9shRgGVruwmr1pdg,2, 
94,AncpvA9shRgGVruwmr1pdg,2,:-(
95,lyNOZ6y_7rGFRRYYMX5nCA,1,"My husband and I went to Ruby's mainly for the salad bar and their sandwiches but, to our surprise we were not pleased with the food."
95,lyNOZ6y_7rGFRRYYMX5nCA,1, I ordered a cheeseburger with grilled onions and steamed zucchini.
95,lyNOZ6y_7rGFRRYYMX5nCA,1,"The zucchini was good but, my burger was hard and dry, it was like they pulled one from a frozen bag not fresh at all."
95,lyNOZ6y_7rGFRRYYMX5nCA,1,"Our bill was $40 we paid without making a fuss but, called back later to get them information about our experience."
95,lyNOZ6y_7rGFRRYYMX5nCA,1, We are still waiting to hear from the general manager.
95,lyNOZ6y_7rGFRRYYMX5nCA,1," This so sad, BurgerPalace used to be one of our favorite restaurants."
96,dK1GcsDQp3UpQDgi4U5OoQ,1,The smell trough out the restaurant is unbearable!
96,dK1GcsDQp3UpQDgi4U5OoQ,1,Please change the mops and water constantly and use some other solutions to clean your floors.
96,dK1GcsDQp3UpQDgi4U5OoQ,1,It takes seconds to feel nauseous and that made me change my mind and leave to another place.
97,51u9uGlwWQLIIapbPl4ADg,2,"Giving this location 2 stars as a benefit of the doubt in a time of post-Covid dining, only because the evening we went for a carryout order, they seemed really short-staffed."
97,51u9uGlwWQLIIapbPl4ADg,2,"The hostess was amazing, and the bartender who took our carryout order was sweet and helpful, but the person who was organizing orders for pickup was clearly having a bad day."
97,51u9uGlwWQLIIapbPl4ADg,2,"Yikes, what a bad experience!!"
97,51u9uGlwWQLIIapbPl4ADg,2,We would NOT return to this location!
97,51u9uGlwWQLIIapbPl4ADg,2,"Along with other patrons whose orders took forever, were messed up, or missing, we waited over 45 minutes for a  terrible overcooked burger, soggy ""roasted"" zucchini, and a flavorless Southwest chicken bowl."
97,51u9uGlwWQLIIapbPl4ADg,2,"Awful, awful."
97,51u9uGlwWQLIIapbPl4ADg,2,The majority of both meals went into the trash.
97,51u9uGlwWQLIIapbPl4ADg,2,"BurgerPalace is generally a basic, reliable restaurant, so maybe our visit was a fluke?"
97,51u9uGlwWQLIIapbPl4ADg,2,But I am certainly not going back.
98,i9cwVIs12zvXkqmps9p3pQ,1,I was looking for a carry out burger the afternoon on April 23.
98,i9cwVIs12zvXkqmps9p3pQ,1,At approximately 4:00 I found a website that I thought was BurgerPalace on Guilford Rd in Frederick Md.
98,i9cwVIs12zvXkqmps9p3pQ,1,it was the right BurgerPalace but it turned out that the website was a company called Postmate.
98,i9cwVIs12zvXkqmps9p3pQ,1,I ordered the food with no problem and paid with a credit card.
98,i9cwVIs12zvXkqmps9p3pQ,1,I immediately got a text on my phone that the food would be ready in 20 minutes.
98,i9cwVIs12zvXkqmps9p3pQ,1,20 minutes later I arrived at the restaurant and had to call to announce my arrival.
98,i9cwVIs12zvXkqmps9p3pQ,1,I was told that someone would come out to the car(Coronavirus).
98,i9cwVIs12zvXkqmps9p3pQ,1,A young lady came out to the car with a bill.
98,i9cwVIs12zvXkqmps9p3pQ,1,I told her I had already paid and she went back in to check.
98,i9cwVIs12zvXkqmps9p3pQ,1,She came back out and said I hadn't and I then showed her my internet receipt.
98,i9cwVIs12zvXkqmps9p3pQ,1,"She said ""Oh, Postmate""."
98,i9cwVIs12zvXkqmps9p3pQ,1,She went back inside and returned with my burger.
98,i9cwVIs12zvXkqmps9p3pQ,1,I tipped her and drove to the other side of the parking lot.
98,i9cwVIs12zvXkqmps9p3pQ,1,I opened the container and opened my cold bacon cheeseburger.
98,i9cwVIs12zvXkqmps9p3pQ,1,I immediately drove back to the restaurant and called.
98,i9cwVIs12zvXkqmps9p3pQ,1,The young lady came back out and I requested hot food.
98,i9cwVIs12zvXkqmps9p3pQ,1,She went back inside and returned in a couple minutes with the same food.
98,i9cwVIs12zvXkqmps9p3pQ,1, She told me that the manager said that I would have to deal with Postmate with any problems.
98,i9cwVIs12zvXkqmps9p3pQ,1,"I said I just wanted hot food, not a refund."
98,i9cwVIs12zvXkqmps9p3pQ,1,She said that was the manager's answer.
98,i9cwVIs12zvXkqmps9p3pQ,1,I left with the cold food and called the manager the next day when I wasn't too angry To speak civilly and was told that when you order through a third party the third party is responsible.
98,i9cwVIs12zvXkqmps9p3pQ,1,I emailed BurgerPalace corporate and have not heard back.
98,i9cwVIs12zvXkqmps9p3pQ,1,Postmate also is not returning emails and does not list a phone number.
98,i9cwVIs12zvXkqmps9p3pQ,1, I do not understand how a restaurant can refuse to take responsibility for the quality of the food they serve.
98,i9cwVIs12zvXkqmps9p3pQ,1,Very Unhappy.
98,i9cwVIs12zvXkqmps9p3pQ,1,Will never return.
99,XelZNxSbc1GacH9QVzGWgg,4,Definitely keeping them in the happy hour rotation.
99,XelZNxSbc1GacH9QVzGWgg,4,The ruby relaxer is amazing.
99,XelZNxSbc1GacH9QVzGWgg,4,"Feet, beer and drink deals"
100,92C07T1zMqPIEeMJ9YKV9g,4,We dine here quite often.
100,92C07T1zMqPIEeMJ9YKV9g,4, The food and the service us usually very good.
100,92C07T1zMqPIEeMJ9YKV9g,4, Five stars.
100,92C07T1zMqPIEeMJ9YKV9g,4," However, Friday, 15 July 2022, I had the steak and rib combo."
100,92C07T1zMqPIEeMJ9YKV9g,4, The ribs tasted old and were a bit hard.
100,92C07T1zMqPIEeMJ9YKV9g,4," The steak was supposed to be a ribeye, according to the menu, but they served me a sirloin."
100,92C07T1zMqPIEeMJ9YKV9g,4," It was perfectly cooked, but sirloins are tougher than ribeyes and have less fat."
100,92C07T1zMqPIEeMJ9YKV9g,4," The service was good except she saw I had eaten one bite of steak, one rib, and did not take any with me.  Still get four stars because this has only happened once.  I will come back."
101,zmrbOomJWD7f1oOFTYiRxQ,3,It was very cold inside.
101,zmrbOomJWD7f1oOFTYiRxQ,3,"Our food took forever, our waiter was flighty."
101,zmrbOomJWD7f1oOFTYiRxQ,3,When it came my quesadilla was burnt on the bottom.
101,zmrbOomJWD7f1oOFTYiRxQ,3,To be fair the manager was aware of the problem and came over and asked to see it.
101,zmrbOomJWD7f1oOFTYiRxQ,3,He gave us a discount on the bill and offered to have another one made.
101,zmrbOomJWD7f1oOFTYiRxQ,3,I had already eaten the brisket out of the middle which excellent and did not want another.
101,zmrbOomJWD7f1oOFTYiRxQ,3,Will probably not go back.
102,078NPHdIaGffXn-OgCqosg,5,Since Covid I have been using this location weekly because it's been consistently good.
102,078NPHdIaGffXn-OgCqosg,5,"Despite being short staffed and slammed with Grubhub/Doordash orders, we get well prepared food."
102,078NPHdIaGffXn-OgCqosg,5,"I only eat inside occasionally, but we haven't encountered any issues other than an extended wait, which we expected under current conditions."
102,078NPHdIaGffXn-OgCqosg,5,Out server still returned to our table and checked on us many times.
102,078NPHdIaGffXn-OgCqosg,5,Our takeout is always hot and neatly packaged to go.
102,078NPHdIaGffXn-OgCqosg,5,Staff have been very friendly.
102,078NPHdIaGffXn-OgCqosg,5,They get our business so often because they give us better service than other local places.
102,078NPHdIaGffXn-OgCqosg,5,"As for the food, it is a chain with specific ways of preparing dishes, so you either like their style or not."
102,078NPHdIaGffXn-OgCqosg,5,"We do, and this location is way more consistent than the ones in surrounding areas."
103,qhOBPGiMVBJoDQOvK1vSWA,1,Waited twenty minutes to be seated.
103,qhOBPGiMVBJoDQOvK1vSWA,1,"There were tables open, they were not at full capacity, just no one manning the hostess area."
103,qhOBPGiMVBJoDQOvK1vSWA,1,I even tried calling while I was standing there and no one would answer or acknowledge us.
103,qhOBPGiMVBJoDQOvK1vSWA,1,Myself and two groups behind me left.
104,UGl1IKT6CsY8d45oBch2lw,1,The most uneducated restaurant that I know of in Cadillac.
104,UGl1IKT6CsY8d45oBch2lw,1,The ribs sucked!
104,UGl1IKT6CsY8d45oBch2lw,1,Had to have someone make my salad for me ?? Really??
104,UGl1IKT6CsY8d45oBch2lw,1,I'm 54 years old!!
105,YbiE-afweORgtI2TI4Uq6A,4,This was an absolutely great meal!
105,YbiE-afweORgtI2TI4Uq6A,4," Everyone, I ordered 5 different menu plates!"
105,YbiE-afweORgtI2TI4Uq6A,4, They did a fantastic job!
105,YbiE-afweORgtI2TI4Uq6A,4, Thank you so much RT!
105,YbiE-afweORgtI2TI4Uq6A,4," Also I ordered to go, and they called me to ask if I could change one item."
105,YbiE-afweORgtI2TI4Uq6A,4,Love it!
105,YbiE-afweORgtI2TI4Uq6A,4," Can't complain about the service, we got it to go!"
105,YbiE-afweORgtI2TI4Uq6A,4, But they packed everything we could need!
106,V8KuS9O2XzzSXDw66FL3vQ,1,Very dark and cold.
106,V8KuS9O2XzzSXDw66FL3vQ,1,Being seated was unorganized and unprofessional.
106,V8KuS9O2XzzSXDw66FL3vQ,1,Our server was very nice however the drinks were not good.
106,V8KuS9O2XzzSXDw66FL3vQ,1,We got our appetizer and it was practically cold.
106,V8KuS9O2XzzSXDw66FL3vQ,1,I had the pasta which tasted like rubber and their broccoli and cheese soup was not great either.
106,V8KuS9O2XzzSXDw66FL3vQ,1,Their fajitas were fine however I wouldn't recommend this place what so ever.
107,fksXMB9OZ4x6HfA7-hbujw,2,"We were in Cadillac , Michigan on Sunday."
107,fksXMB9OZ4x6HfA7-hbujw,2,"we ordered rib eye with asparagus and sweet potato, it was pretty good."
107,fksXMB9OZ4x6HfA7-hbujw,2,"waitress was very nice, and food was delivered promptly."
107,fksXMB9OZ4x6HfA7-hbujw,2,problem was the place was filthy.
107,fksXMB9OZ4x6HfA7-hbujw,2,The wooden booth was grimy & sticky.
107,fksXMB9OZ4x6HfA7-hbujw,2,"The carpet was filthy, the seat was dirty, which I asked them to wipe off, and the table had hair on it."
107,fksXMB9OZ4x6HfA7-hbujw,2,over all not great.
107,fksXMB9OZ4x6HfA7-hbujw,2,I would suggest you shut the place down for a day and have a thorough scrubbing of the whole facility.
108,wzTLKMDzchnHnDkO5-ntOg,5,We really enjoy the menu choices at RT.
108,wzTLKMDzchnHnDkO5-ntOg,5,It's getting more and more difficult to find any.
108,wzTLKMDzchnHnDkO5-ntOg,5,All the ones near us have closed.
109,k47Xhke6A84NQnMaoKeNzQ,1,0 stars for this restaurant...
109,k47Xhke6A84NQnMaoKeNzQ,1,"With the exception of Megan, our server, she was a 10!"
109,k47Xhke6A84NQnMaoKeNzQ,1,it was an experience that will never be repeated.
109,k47Xhke6A84NQnMaoKeNzQ,1, 
109,k47Xhke6A84NQnMaoKeNzQ,1,Enter...approx. 5 pm...quiet only a few customers.
109,k47Xhke6A84NQnMaoKeNzQ,1," We experienced the cluster of ""shift change which should be transparent...but we were introduced to 3 ppl, then ended up with our original server...Megan, who couldn't have been more apologetic."
109,k47Xhke6A84NQnMaoKeNzQ,1,So we are thinking salad bar...but when we view it...most everything was nearly empty...
109,k47Xhke6A84NQnMaoKeNzQ,1,when we asked about it
109,k47Xhke6A84NQnMaoKeNzQ,1,...no one seemed too interested in restoking.
109,k47Xhke6A84NQnMaoKeNzQ,1, I think no one could decide whose job it was...the regional manager is too busy on his phone to guide and direct.
109,k47Xhke6A84NQnMaoKeNzQ,1,  It was dinner time remember.
109,k47Xhke6A84NQnMaoKeNzQ,1,  So we ordered cocktails...good prices...the regular margarita was good...but don't order a second...it was an entirely different tasting and sweet....same bartender.?
109,k47Xhke6A84NQnMaoKeNzQ,1,Sent it back...the second was better but not like the first.
109,k47Xhke6A84NQnMaoKeNzQ,1, $6.00.So
109,k47Xhke6A84NQnMaoKeNzQ,1,the salad bar gets replenished... that's our choice...
109,k47Xhke6A84NQnMaoKeNzQ,1,no soup!Now
109,k47Xhke6A84NQnMaoKeNzQ,1,my friend starts eating and bites into a metal carton staple...ypu know like the kind from a box of produce...sharp and open pronged...an inch or more long with sharp edges ( it was in her salad bowl....we didnt put it there!!! )
109,k47Xhke6A84NQnMaoKeNzQ,1,"So we call Megan, she is appalled ( my friend did not swollow it thank god)...so she - Megan - says..."" we are lucky...the regional manager is there today...she will go get him"""
109,k47Xhke6A84NQnMaoKeNzQ,1,....
109,k47Xhke6A84NQnMaoKeNzQ,1,"""He"" could have cared less, on the phone, made us wait, cannot remember an apology...said he needed to get a report from my friend...left and never returned.."
109,k47Xhke6A84NQnMaoKeNzQ,1,.Megan had my friends salad comped...and we couldnt get out of there fast enough.
109,k47Xhke6A84NQnMaoKeNzQ,1,"The place needs a good cleaning, managers who care as much as the staff, attention to details/TLC..and far better customer service."
109,k47Xhke6A84NQnMaoKeNzQ,1," Judging from the regionals lack of concern and safety for his customers and the appearance and the lack of cleanliness of his restaurant...i assure you ""we""... and our local friends will NOT be back...and"
109,k47Xhke6A84NQnMaoKeNzQ,1,we have...and will continue to tell our friends..( Ellenton-FL )
110,ZKAYb0ElWWYcykw4BrNDGw,1,"Went there yesterday at 3:00pm, one customer waiting and was told 5 min wait because they only had one server."
110,ZKAYb0ElWWYcykw4BrNDGw,1,Waited 25 minutes and finally left.
110,ZKAYb0ElWWYcykw4BrNDGw,1,This is my 2nd incident with the Ellenton location.
110,ZKAYb0ElWWYcykw4BrNDGw,1,The 1st time we went and appeared closed on a Monday with no sign saying closed.
110,ZKAYb0ElWWYcykw4BrNDGw,1,I doubt I will ever go there again.
110,ZKAYb0ElWWYcykw4BrNDGw,1,They used to be a good restaurant.
111,9B2g5Z_V2Vu4dD2eR5dwlg,3,Came for lunch with a group of friends on the 1st of June.
111,9B2g5Z_V2Vu4dD2eR5dwlg,3,"I hadn't been in quite some time and I do love their salad bar, so I picked this place for us to go have lunch."
111,9B2g5Z_V2Vu4dD2eR5dwlg,3,"To all of our surprises, there is no longer a lunch menu."
111,9B2g5Z_V2Vu4dD2eR5dwlg,3,This is quite disappointing as they used to have a great lunch choices and you could add on the salad bar for one or two dollars.
111,9B2g5Z_V2Vu4dD2eR5dwlg,3,Adding the salad bar to any entree is now $6.
111,9B2g5Z_V2Vu4dD2eR5dwlg,3,All of the entrees are also upwards of $20 which I find quite expensive for a place like BurgerPalace
111,9B2g5Z_V2Vu4dD2eR5dwlg,3,"The salad bar was just as good as I remembered, so there were no issues there, but everything else is very mediocre."
111,9B2g5Z_V2Vu4dD2eR5dwlg,3,"It also took us almost 30 minutes to get our check, which was quite frustrating."
111,9B2g5Z_V2Vu4dD2eR5dwlg,3,I do not think I will return anytime soon.
112,_wZgD6KM9Muq_0vDY9pp8Q,2,"Kind of disappointed but with not coming to a BurgerPalace in a long time, maybe it's the norm."
112,_wZgD6KM9Muq_0vDY9pp8Q,2," Bottom line, they are short staffed."
112,_wZgD6KM9Muq_0vDY9pp8Q,2, Our server was complaining because she had to drive in from Mt Dora.
112,_wZgD6KM9Muq_0vDY9pp8Q,2, 
112,_wZgD6KM9Muq_0vDY9pp8Q,2,Not sure what was going on.  
112,_wZgD6KM9Muq_0vDY9pp8Q,2,"A large party of 8 who were elderly, left, and were very upset."
112,_wZgD6KM9Muq_0vDY9pp8Q,2, My party sat in the bar so we could accommodate the staff.
112,_wZgD6KM9Muq_0vDY9pp8Q,2, It was weird as I don't like to feel uncomfortable but it was just that.
112,_wZgD6KM9Muq_0vDY9pp8Q,2," Food is so-so, just ordinary."
112,_wZgD6KM9Muq_0vDY9pp8Q,2, I realize we're still hurting from the pandemic but pick it up or shut it down!
113,ZaCM1FJwJqJcCLwKX2lg_A,1,I was sooooo excited about BurgerPalace and I was soooooo disappointed!
113,ZaCM1FJwJqJcCLwKX2lg_A,1,The hostess was not there and when another lady came over she was rude as hell!
113,ZaCM1FJwJqJcCLwKX2lg_A,1,And the food wasn't that great.
113,ZaCM1FJwJqJcCLwKX2lg_A,1,There was a lady who was sweeping the floor and she was the sweetest lady every.
113,ZaCM1FJwJqJcCLwKX2lg_A,1,Now we understand why they are closing down across the country.
113,ZaCM1FJwJqJcCLwKX2lg_A,1,We shall never go back.
114,FTOSkRwm0uq-N7ICqsQKxQ,1,Had a bad experience today unfortunately!It
114,FTOSkRwm0uq-N7ICqsQKxQ,1,"took forever for a waiter to come and take our drink order - once they finally showed up, they didn't bring out all the drinks - we waited for a lemonade for quite a while."
114,FTOSkRwm0uq-N7ICqsQKxQ,1,Then we had to wait again to place the food order.
114,FTOSkRwm0uq-N7ICqsQKxQ,1,The food got out very slow and the taste wasn't that great.
114,FTOSkRwm0uq-N7ICqsQKxQ,1,My kid loves pasta and she didn't like hers.
114,FTOSkRwm0uq-N7ICqsQKxQ,1,They did apologize at the end - but it was a bad experience overall!
114,FTOSkRwm0uq-N7ICqsQKxQ,1,The restaurant was almost empty and many servers were present - so not sure why it took them so long.
114,FTOSkRwm0uq-N7ICqsQKxQ,1,"I saw a few standing around, one even on her phone, having a private conversation (in the middle of the restaurant - she didn't even care to go somewhere, where she can't be seen) We will not be back!"
115,sIJyYCe3Q6E-p00FO2Ys_Q,1,"Drove 2 hours just for a little sign on host table inside saying ""closing at 8pm"" .. when website and doors say closing at 10pm ."
116,XQ8qngrukGL05cU_EK3dBw,1,Food was inedible.
116,XQ8qngrukGL05cU_EK3dBw,1,"Ordered their ""fall off the bone"" ribs and they were tough as can be."
116,XQ8qngrukGL05cU_EK3dBw,1,The chips for the nachos were burnt and the whole plate was dry.
116,XQ8qngrukGL05cU_EK3dBw,1,Overall not a pleasant experience.
116,XQ8qngrukGL05cU_EK3dBw,1,The  cups sat empty and food took almost an hour.
116,XQ8qngrukGL05cU_EK3dBw,1,Steaks were ordered medium and came out more than well done.
116,XQ8qngrukGL05cU_EK3dBw,1,Not what I expected with the restaurant almost half empty on a Thursday evening.
116,XQ8qngrukGL05cU_EK3dBw,1,We explained our complaints to the server but nothing was fixed.
117,qoPSaHt0m4n3wy80jkHixg,2,Things have changed since we are getting back to normal after the virus.
117,qoPSaHt0m4n3wy80jkHixg,2,Food is still good but prices have gone up.
117,qoPSaHt0m4n3wy80jkHixg,2,In February 2022 the salad bar in now $12.95.
117,qoPSaHt0m4n3wy80jkHixg,2,Also they are having staffing problems as we had to wait 45 minutes for a table at 5 pm when there were several empty tables.
117,qoPSaHt0m4n3wy80jkHixg,2,We asked why and were told they have not enough staff.
118,iQPeXVy2HZtu5-CvXE7cHg,1,This place was a big disappointment.
118,iQPeXVy2HZtu5-CvXE7cHg,1," I was there the night of Sunday, July 10th."
118,iQPeXVy2HZtu5-CvXE7cHg,1,They were out of brisket and fries.
118,iQPeXVy2HZtu5-CvXE7cHg,1, Who runs out of fries?????  
118,iQPeXVy2HZtu5-CvXE7cHg,1,Half the menu was based off brisket and fries.
118,iQPeXVy2HZtu5-CvXE7cHg,1, No silverware for my salad.
118,iQPeXVy2HZtu5-CvXE7cHg,1," I watched the lettuce turn brown before a nice person next to me, gave me their un used set."
118,iQPeXVy2HZtu5-CvXE7cHg,1,No one looked like they were in charge at this place.
118,iQPeXVy2HZtu5-CvXE7cHg,1, Corporate should take over this location and clean house.
118,iQPeXVy2HZtu5-CvXE7cHg,1,Good luck.
119,vC_Gm7IYENtMWDbdZjobqQ,4,"Last restaurant on this street we hadn't been to, next door to Cracker Barrel."
119,vC_Gm7IYENtMWDbdZjobqQ,4,We came here previously on Fri night and was 45 min wait tonight it was immediate seating.
119,vC_Gm7IYENtMWDbdZjobqQ,4,Once you are inside dining area see there are quite a lot of tables.
119,vC_Gm7IYENtMWDbdZjobqQ,4,Ruby's has a stand alone salad bar that they offer for $11.99 by itself.
119,vC_Gm7IYENtMWDbdZjobqQ,4,I can tell you it isn't worth that price for the choices.
119,vC_Gm7IYENtMWDbdZjobqQ,4,"Another option is add to entree for $4.99, this is better deal."
119,vC_Gm7IYENtMWDbdZjobqQ,4,"My draft Blue Moon beer ordered tasted ""old"" and waitress replaced w Miller Lite bottle even though I said Mich Ultra."
119,vC_Gm7IYENtMWDbdZjobqQ,4,Little things like this bring ratings down IMO.
119,vC_Gm7IYENtMWDbdZjobqQ,4,Our food was decent although did take a while to be made.
119,vC_Gm7IYENtMWDbdZjobqQ,4,"The Texcado which is just folded pita bread w cheese, oil, and chicken was good for $8.99."
119,vC_Gm7IYENtMWDbdZjobqQ,4,My wife has something w chicken said was good and her Hard Lemonade was strong.
119,vC_Gm7IYENtMWDbdZjobqQ,4,"All this for $40, 35 if I hadn't added the salad."
119,vC_Gm7IYENtMWDbdZjobqQ,4,Overall pretty good meal.
120,n-6U7tmyDTL8ZyUE6ZyL6Q,2,The food was just okay.
120,n-6U7tmyDTL8ZyUE6ZyL6Q,2,The wait to take our order was lengthy.
120,n-6U7tmyDTL8ZyUE6ZyL6Q,2,Our sever was nice .
120,n-6U7tmyDTL8ZyUE6ZyL6Q,2,The food was fresh.
120,n-6U7tmyDTL8ZyUE6ZyL6Q,2,Glad we stopped.
121,gGOxy9x2XOYGcIXjs74Jvw,1,Ordered a hamburger with cheese and bacon to go.
121,gGOxy9x2XOYGcIXjs74Jvw,1,One of the worst burgers I've ever had.
121,gGOxy9x2XOYGcIXjs74Jvw,1,The burger was so overcooked.
121,gGOxy9x2XOYGcIXjs74Jvw,1,It was dry and crusty on the edges.
121,gGOxy9x2XOYGcIXjs74Jvw,1,There was one  slice of tomato that was the size of a Roma tomato slice a tablespoon of shredded lettuce.
121,gGOxy9x2XOYGcIXjs74Jvw,1,No onion (which is listed as part of the burger) no Mayo no mustard.
121,gGOxy9x2XOYGcIXjs74Jvw,1,HORRIBLE.
121,gGOxy9x2XOYGcIXjs74Jvw,1,I won't go back.
121,gGOxy9x2XOYGcIXjs74Jvw,1,I gave this restaurant a one star because it wouldn't let me post until I rated it.
121,gGOxy9x2XOYGcIXjs74Jvw,1,Too bad there aren't half stars.
122,wABnBdRS2_eqBoS4SPQxzw,1,Food was good.
122,wABnBdRS2_eqBoS4SPQxzw,1,Service was the worst I ever had.
122,wABnBdRS2_eqBoS4SPQxzw,1,DO NOT GO THERE!  
122,wABnBdRS2_eqBoS4SPQxzw,1,The waiter was pleasant but that's all I'll give him.
122,wABnBdRS2_eqBoS4SPQxzw,1,I wanted to leave him a tip but I just could not justify it.
122,wABnBdRS2_eqBoS4SPQxzw,1,The rest of my party would have had my hide if I had.
122,wABnBdRS2_eqBoS4SPQxzw,1,Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else.
123,TzrU9OpbbcGa3SBTbe-PxQ,2,"The waitress was very pleasant, and the dining room was reasonably clean."
123,TzrU9OpbbcGa3SBTbe-PxQ,2, I ordered the salmon and two sides.
123,TzrU9OpbbcGa3SBTbe-PxQ,2, They were out of broccoli so i ordered two sides of zucchini.
123,TzrU9OpbbcGa3SBTbe-PxQ,2, My dinner shows up and it is a smaller piece of salmon and like 9 pieces of zucchini.
123,TzrU9OpbbcGa3SBTbe-PxQ,2, The food tasted great but there was not enough of it.
123,TzrU9OpbbcGa3SBTbe-PxQ,2, If it was a $12 plate I would not be disappointed.
123,TzrU9OpbbcGa3SBTbe-PxQ,2, This meal was $24 out the door.
123,TzrU9OpbbcGa3SBTbe-PxQ,2,Not worth it.
124,xxbRpZClplP8rqxZvEALKA,1,Waited 10 minutes to be seated and no one came.
124,xxbRpZClplP8rqxZvEALKA,1,One person that worked there saw us then turned around and went then other way.
124,xxbRpZClplP8rqxZvEALKA,1,Other customers advised that we should go somewhere else.
124,xxbRpZClplP8rqxZvEALKA,1,They waited 30 minutes on their food and it never came.
125,QS3OilVoKTCO0j0jIvjCcg,1,Not a fantastic start for this establishment.
125,QS3OilVoKTCO0j0jIvjCcg,1,"To begin, we waited forever to even get recognized when entering the building."
125,QS3OilVoKTCO0j0jIvjCcg,1,A bell would be a good start to get some decent service.
125,QS3OilVoKTCO0j0jIvjCcg,1,The lady that sat us was friendly.
125,QS3OilVoKTCO0j0jIvjCcg,1,"Upon ordering our food, our waiter was too busy looking around to listen to our order - and no."
125,QS3OilVoKTCO0j0jIvjCcg,1,He did not write it down.
125,QS3OilVoKTCO0j0jIvjCcg,1,"So when our food came out overcooked and incorrect, to say I'm not surprised is an understatement."
125,QS3OilVoKTCO0j0jIvjCcg,1,Spinach and Artichoke dip app: good luck.
125,QS3OilVoKTCO0j0jIvjCcg,1,Came out 2 minutes before our food did.
125,QS3OilVoKTCO0j0jIvjCcg,1,Steak: overcooked.
125,QS3OilVoKTCO0j0jIvjCcg,1,Rice: overcooked.
125,QS3OilVoKTCO0j0jIvjCcg,1,Chicken dinner: the entirely wrong one.
125,QS3OilVoKTCO0j0jIvjCcg,1,It's a good thing I don't have a mushroom allergy.
125,QS3OilVoKTCO0j0jIvjCcg,1,"Instead of getting the Chicken Fresco like I asked for, I got the Chicken Asiago."
125,QS3OilVoKTCO0j0jIvjCcg,1,Which has mushrooms.
125,QS3OilVoKTCO0j0jIvjCcg,1,A drink refill?
125,QS3OilVoKTCO0j0jIvjCcg,1,Good luck.
125,QS3OilVoKTCO0j0jIvjCcg,1,Our waiter was more worried about serving the other table instead of us.
125,QS3OilVoKTCO0j0jIvjCcg,1,The same people who walked in 10 minutes after us got their food 15 minutes before we did.
125,QS3OilVoKTCO0j0jIvjCcg,1,And we placed our order first.
125,QS3OilVoKTCO0j0jIvjCcg,1,To say I'm not impressed is an understatement.
125,QS3OilVoKTCO0j0jIvjCcg,1,We won't be back.
125,QS3OilVoKTCO0j0jIvjCcg,1,I'm sincerely disappointed.
125,QS3OilVoKTCO0j0jIvjCcg,1,They have such great potential here but lack the staff capable of making it such.
126,Hn60DYcgBoqVD4t8l-ssCQ,3,"Food was average at best, no draft beer at all."
126,Hn60DYcgBoqVD4t8l-ssCQ,3,  Bar area is closed off.
126,Hn60DYcgBoqVD4t8l-ssCQ,3,"  Our waitress was outstanding, very funny and engaging."
126,Hn60DYcgBoqVD4t8l-ssCQ,3,"  Nothing special, but there was no other option in my over night while traveling."
127,kONPb3wAOiKAFgHTfbIWMA,1,First time at this location.
127,kONPb3wAOiKAFgHTfbIWMA,1,We are from Florida and frequent BurgerPalace T's as one of our favorite lunch and dinner spots.
127,kONPb3wAOiKAFgHTfbIWMA,1,We will never go back to this one in Florence SC.
127,kONPb3wAOiKAFgHTfbIWMA,1,"The salad bar was unkept, sloppy, spring mix was old, several empty spots that were not being filled with salad bar items."
127,kONPb3wAOiKAFgHTfbIWMA,1,"It was going to be my main meal because as a vegan, nothing on the menu accommodated my diet."
127,kONPb3wAOiKAFgHTfbIWMA,1, The other person in my party was happy ordering a burger.
127,kONPb3wAOiKAFgHTfbIWMA,1, When I asked if the chef could make me a pasta dish with a few veggies he told me they were out of broccoli.
127,kONPb3wAOiKAFgHTfbIWMA,1,He told me they could not use the zucchini either.
127,kONPb3wAOiKAFgHTfbIWMA,1, I felt sorry for our waiter because it was not his fault.
127,kONPb3wAOiKAFgHTfbIWMA,1, We decided to leave.
127,kONPb3wAOiKAFgHTfbIWMA,1,But the night had a good ending - We had an amazing meal at the Olive Garden and enjoyed the rest of our evening.
127,kONPb3wAOiKAFgHTfbIWMA,1, BurgerPalace T needs to seriously rethink how they run their kitchen and staff.
127,kONPb3wAOiKAFgHTfbIWMA,1, We should have looked at the reviews.
127,kONPb3wAOiKAFgHTfbIWMA,1,The parking lot was empty at dinner time.
127,kONPb3wAOiKAFgHTfbIWMA,1,Wonder why???
128,o7IQEo-1qe0dAbsk8fGZ2A,3,Food is alright.
128,o7IQEo-1qe0dAbsk8fGZ2A,3,The salad bar is great.
128,o7IQEo-1qe0dAbsk8fGZ2A,3,I like the Alfredo noodles here.
128,o7IQEo-1qe0dAbsk8fGZ2A,3,The customer service wasn't so great..
129,hLvPWuYzK0rZcJ3E__Kbhw,1,As always BurgerPalace food and service is in need of help.
129,hLvPWuYzK0rZcJ3E__Kbhw,1,Had shrimp scampi.
129,hLvPWuYzK0rZcJ3E__Kbhw,1,Pasta was cold shrimp was mixed with some fresh cooked and some left over over cooked ones.
129,hLvPWuYzK0rZcJ3E__Kbhw,1,No scampi sauce anywhere.
129,hLvPWuYzK0rZcJ3E__Kbhw,1,No server to complain to.
129,hLvPWuYzK0rZcJ3E__Kbhw,1,No manager around to greeting guests.
130,eIqhcDkk43joZF1VzUI09A,1,They had us waiting for 15 minutes for a host and they gave us unsweetened tea when I've ask them to give me sweet tea
131,lnmrRKIvdsoHElqIjXiUlA,1,"Nastiest food I've ever had, pasta looked like it came out a bag...there was no pasta sauce with the pasta, the place was dirty and it didn't smell very well."
131,lnmrRKIvdsoHElqIjXiUlA,1,"Waitress was all over the food, felt very unsanitary"
132,_gfFWEBzLHuK54h-vCod6w,1,I was trying to call them to place a to-go order and they didnt answer.
132,_gfFWEBzLHuK54h-vCod6w,1,About 50 min before closing time still and so i found a way to place an order online and so i did.
132,_gfFWEBzLHuK54h-vCod6w,1,When i arrived at within the time frame (about 2min before they close) mentioned and wasn't even greeted.
132,_gfFWEBzLHuK54h-vCod6w,1,There was no customer and I've seen they were already cleaning.
132,_gfFWEBzLHuK54h-vCod6w,1,I told them i have a to-go order and they said that my order was something they out of.
132,_gfFWEBzLHuK54h-vCod6w,1,I asked why wasn't I  notified.
132,_gfFWEBzLHuK54h-vCod6w,1,They replied that they dont have a way of letting me know.
132,_gfFWEBzLHuK54h-vCod6w,1,"Fine, let say that's true."
132,_gfFWEBzLHuK54h-vCod6w,1,"They weren't even apathetic about it, wasn't offered a solution and did no5 apologized for the inconvenience."
132,_gfFWEBzLHuK54h-vCod6w,1,I ended up with a fast food birthday meal and went back to work.
133,97suBDh8VYspGJNFOs2CQQ,1,DO NOT DELIVER FROM HERE.
133,97suBDh8VYspGJNFOs2CQQ,1,Ordered a chicken caesar salad and the dressing was poured on lettuce already and it was like soup.
133,97suBDh8VYspGJNFOs2CQQ,1,TERRIBLE
134,3rxAjmvCKekFCRxjW8qpqg,1,I paid $70 SEVENTY DOLLARS for THIS!!
134,3rxAjmvCKekFCRxjW8qpqg,1,My wife's 6oz medium rare steak is 5.2 oz and very rare.
134,3rxAjmvCKekFCRxjW8qpqg,1,I'm missing an entire side.
135,xKG3KM228c6rzICMlw8D8A,1,Never coming here again.
135,xKG3KM228c6rzICMlw8D8A,1,When you walk in there is this weird smell.
135,xKG3KM228c6rzICMlw8D8A,1,When you walk to your table the floors feel sticky and the booths are dirty every time.
135,xKG3KM228c6rzICMlw8D8A,1,They seem to never have enough staff around so you wait awhile till you get a drink order.
135,xKG3KM228c6rzICMlw8D8A,1,Oh and your food will most likely be wrong.
135,xKG3KM228c6rzICMlw8D8A,1,Don't recommend this place.
136,q1oHsTaETkWD58O7SXF53Q,5,"Such tasty food for each of our party of three-pasta, fish and chicken PLUS artichoke dip leading it off!"
136,q1oHsTaETkWD58O7SXF53Q,5, Cannot say what a pleasure the salad bar is too.
136,q1oHsTaETkWD58O7SXF53Q,5,Thank goodness they continue to serve it up in a world of puny or lost salad bars!
136,q1oHsTaETkWD58O7SXF53Q,5, 
136,q1oHsTaETkWD58O7SXF53Q,5,"Wonderful waitstaff so friendly, knowledgeable and efficient."
136,q1oHsTaETkWD58O7SXF53Q,5,Almost forgot to mention the margaritas... started us off very nicely on the journey- thank you BurgerPalace
137,r8dhhy2zWzefxDwQv8B9KQ,1,"This location is terrible, the hostess very rude to start off and hey everyone has a bad day so I let it slide."
137,r8dhhy2zWzefxDwQv8B9KQ,1,Our waitress was really nice but not waitress material.
137,r8dhhy2zWzefxDwQv8B9KQ,1,We waited for 15 minutes for drinks which were not correct when we got them.
137,r8dhhy2zWzefxDwQv8B9KQ,1,The bathrooms were disgusting!
137,r8dhhy2zWzefxDwQv8B9KQ,1,The salad bar was a disaster.
137,r8dhhy2zWzefxDwQv8B9KQ,1,The food was over cooked and tasted terrible.
137,r8dhhy2zWzefxDwQv8B9KQ,1,Way over priced for what you get!
137,r8dhhy2zWzefxDwQv8B9KQ,1,Definitely don't go to this location.
138,UhMS9ifL4l1jbdJq_GHpxw,4,Awesome Salad bar!!
138,UhMS9ifL4l1jbdJq_GHpxw,4,Worth coming just for that.
138,UhMS9ifL4l1jbdJq_GHpxw,4,The salad bar is open and self serving despite COVID.
138,UhMS9ifL4l1jbdJq_GHpxw,4,You just have to wear one glove.
138,UhMS9ifL4l1jbdJq_GHpxw,4,I also ordered wings for lunch with a sweet tea.
138,UhMS9ifL4l1jbdJq_GHpxw,4,It's what I wanted and expected.
138,UhMS9ifL4l1jbdJq_GHpxw,4,Our server was friendly and training a new girl.
138,UhMS9ifL4l1jbdJq_GHpxw,4,Overall great experience and I recommend it
138,UhMS9ifL4l1jbdJq_GHpxw,4,"Of note, I came here for a work lunch with 9 others ."
139,ke9NQQj3XiR2YexSRpRq1Q,3,Ok the menu has changed a little since I have been there.
139,ke9NQQj3XiR2YexSRpRq1Q,3,And there is more variety then before.
139,ke9NQQj3XiR2YexSRpRq1Q,3,I have been in several time and they have a little something different past there normal menu most  of the time.
139,ke9NQQj3XiR2YexSRpRq1Q,3,I suppose it is a out frequency.
139,ke9NQQj3XiR2YexSRpRq1Q,3,During the day it seems too dark in there for me.
139,ke9NQQj3XiR2YexSRpRq1Q,3,During the evening the lighting is good.
139,ke9NQQj3XiR2YexSRpRq1Q,3,The decor needs an update in my opinion.
139,ke9NQQj3XiR2YexSRpRq1Q,3,Otherwise the place is very normal and plain looking.
139,ke9NQQj3XiR2YexSRpRq1Q,3,Food...
139,ke9NQQj3XiR2YexSRpRq1Q,3,my wife and I had the chicken fajitas.
139,ke9NQQj3XiR2YexSRpRq1Q,3,My chicken had some burn spots on it that I couldn't chew through.
139,ke9NQQj3XiR2YexSRpRq1Q,3,"It was just a little bit but that sticks in your mind, you know."
139,ke9NQQj3XiR2YexSRpRq1Q,3,It tasted good and the vegetables were cooked well.
139,ke9NQQj3XiR2YexSRpRq1Q,3,We also got the salid bar.
139,ke9NQQj3XiR2YexSRpRq1Q,3,Their salad bar is great.
139,ke9NQQj3XiR2YexSRpRq1Q,3,I think it is probably the best in town.
139,ke9NQQj3XiR2YexSRpRq1Q,3,Service..
139,ke9NQQj3XiR2YexSRpRq1Q,3,our server was quiet.
139,ke9NQQj3XiR2YexSRpRq1Q,3,And she did not come around much.
139,ke9NQQj3XiR2YexSRpRq1Q,3,Not that we really needed anything.
139,ke9NQQj3XiR2YexSRpRq1Q,3,She visited our table four times and one of those was to give us the check.
139,ke9NQQj3XiR2YexSRpRq1Q,3,"Last but not least, price...."
139,ke9NQQj3XiR2YexSRpRq1Q,3,We ate for under 40 dollars that was including the tip.(2 people one ordering water the other a tea)
139,ke9NQQj3XiR2YexSRpRq1Q,3,I would say the menus has both pricey items and less pricey items.
139,ke9NQQj3XiR2YexSRpRq1Q,3,"If you where on a budget, just watch what you order."
139,ke9NQQj3XiR2YexSRpRq1Q,3,"If not, they have something for you too."
140,YgZB87YAbcdDpCDJpxc4uQ,4,The salad bar was fresh and full of goodies!
140,YgZB87YAbcdDpCDJpxc4uQ,4,I plan on coming back purely for the salad bar!
140,YgZB87YAbcdDpCDJpxc4uQ,4,"I ordered crispy chicken sliders, they were ok."
140,YgZB87YAbcdDpCDJpxc4uQ,4,French fries were great.
140,YgZB87YAbcdDpCDJpxc4uQ,4,Fajitas looked amazing.
140,YgZB87YAbcdDpCDJpxc4uQ,4,"Service was alright, drinks got a little low a few times but for the most part it was good."
140,YgZB87YAbcdDpCDJpxc4uQ,4,Great dessert and coffee!
141,PwXX85LTVouTVhFPnp9x6g,1,Avoid at all costs.
141,PwXX85LTVouTVhFPnp9x6g,1,Went in on a Monday.
141,PwXX85LTVouTVhFPnp9x6g,1,Maybe 8-10 tables occupied in the entire restaurant.
141,PwXX85LTVouTVhFPnp9x6g,1,"Waited 5 minutes for anyone to help us, only to be told we would have a 5-10 minute wait for a table."
141,PwXX85LTVouTVhFPnp9x6g,1,In a nearly EMPTY restaurant.
141,PwXX85LTVouTVhFPnp9x6g,1,"Clearly they don't want, need or desire my business, and most likely not yours either."
141,PwXX85LTVouTVhFPnp9x6g,1,Will never return.
142,creDoPV2ZZnspYLgsMoo7A,1,Waiters were short staffed did not get food out in a good time took way too long never got refills
143,h7YOO40RwF212lVdD7sWSg,5,"Lovely staff at this BurgerPalace Our waitress Cory was friendly, attentive, and deserves 10 stars for getting me croutons when they didn't come with my salad."
143,h7YOO40RwF212lVdD7sWSg,5,The glazed honey salmon salad bowl was perfect amount for dinner.
143,h7YOO40RwF212lVdD7sWSg,5,Delicious too.
144,a__A86SlaN1gP2omWSLMuQ,2,"While walking on the strip in Branson Missouri, the wife and I stopped for some food and drinks."
144,a__A86SlaN1gP2omWSLMuQ,2,Thought we would make this stop an early dinner before going to a show and seeing all of the cool tourist traps in the area.
144,a__A86SlaN1gP2omWSLMuQ,2,First things first.
144,a__A86SlaN1gP2omWSLMuQ,2,"Yes, the waitress was new and I believe her inattentiveness was because she was new, so, I'll give her a break on that."
144,a__A86SlaN1gP2omWSLMuQ,2,"Also, I saw most of the draft beers were out because cups covered the taps and since I spend a lot of time in bars, I know that that means."
144,a__A86SlaN1gP2omWSLMuQ,2,"We were there at about 2 or 3 in the afternoon, so the restaurant had been open for a while before we arrived."
144,a__A86SlaN1gP2omWSLMuQ,2,We ordered the salad bar and the steak and rib combo.
144,a__A86SlaN1gP2omWSLMuQ,2,"After I got the salad, I ordered a beer from one of the uncovered taps."
144,a__A86SlaN1gP2omWSLMuQ,2,"Well, after about 30 minutes of waiting for the beer, the waitress finally realized that she hadn't got it for me yet."
144,a__A86SlaN1gP2omWSLMuQ,2,"Well, the tap blew and it was empty."
144,a__A86SlaN1gP2omWSLMuQ,2,"A woman, not the manager, but talked like one came to the table."
144,a__A86SlaN1gP2omWSLMuQ,2,"Offered me a bottle of the beer and would ""adjust"" my tab to the new price."
144,a__A86SlaN1gP2omWSLMuQ,2,Then she said that the ribs were not done and would not be done for about another hour.
144,a__A86SlaN1gP2omWSLMuQ,2, I told her I didn't want the bottle beer and I didn't want meal any longer.
144,a__A86SlaN1gP2omWSLMuQ,2,"  She did us a ""favor"" by only charging us for the salads and soda (the only items we actually got in the hour we spent waiting."
144,a__A86SlaN1gP2omWSLMuQ,2,We walked to another restaurant in the area and had a great meal.
144,a__A86SlaN1gP2omWSLMuQ,2,My only advice if you want to eat at this place is to ask 8fntheir issues have been resolved and if they actually have the food you want.
144,a__A86SlaN1gP2omWSLMuQ,2,"Other than that, not much else you can do."
144,a__A86SlaN1gP2omWSLMuQ,2,Definitely a two star restaurant.
144,a__A86SlaN1gP2omWSLMuQ,2,"I cannot recommend this place, especially if you have time constraints."
145,9ePkIZhM_N30T_FLTIeOTA,2,Hubby & I arrived at 10:30pm after our show for a snack.
145,9ePkIZhM_N30T_FLTIeOTA,2,We were seated and immediately a server took our drink order.
145,9ePkIZhM_N30T_FLTIeOTA,2,I had the Refresher cocktail that is a special $6 drink on Fri & Sat.
145,9ePkIZhM_N30T_FLTIeOTA,2,The drink arrived quickly and was very good.
145,9ePkIZhM_N30T_FLTIeOTA,2,A short time later the wait person took our order of a steak Tacodilla and a piece of carrot cake.
145,9ePkIZhM_N30T_FLTIeOTA,2,"After about 30 min (it's now 11pm, closing time), when people who came after us have ordered and received their food our wait person comes by and says our order ""ran off the bottom of the screen and was forgotten"" so she takes our order again."
145,9ePkIZhM_N30T_FLTIeOTA,2,"Another 30 minutes goes by, now 11:30, still no food, so we left $6 on the table for the drink and left."
145,9ePkIZhM_N30T_FLTIeOTA,2,"Two stars for quick service at first and the drink was tasty, especially for $6."
145,9ePkIZhM_N30T_FLTIeOTA,2,Don't know about the food as we never got any.
146,GhfllUJzON1d3tZLT9N80Q,5,Been a very long time since I have been to  one of these as they are no longer in my area.
146,GhfllUJzON1d3tZLT9N80Q,5,When I saw there was one near our hotel I knew me and my family had to come here.
146,GhfllUJzON1d3tZLT9N80Q,5,We were seated right away and greeted by our waitress shortly after.
146,GhfllUJzON1d3tZLT9N80Q,5,The main Tai I ordered was great and when I ordered the waitress asked if I wanted a large one to which I said yes.
146,GhfllUJzON1d3tZLT9N80Q,5,Our food was as wonderful as I remember.
146,GhfllUJzON1d3tZLT9N80Q,5, Our server was very attentive and took great care of us.
147,TJmE9fkNdFFlAllwVaSihQ,3,"It's okay, it was my first time being there."
147,TJmE9fkNdFFlAllwVaSihQ,3,"My husband and I went after we got tattoos; the lady who took us to our table didn't bring menus, but the staff was super nice"
147,TJmE9fkNdFFlAllwVaSihQ,3,.
147,TJmE9fkNdFFlAllwVaSihQ,3,The food was alright.
147,TJmE9fkNdFFlAllwVaSihQ,3,Not my favorite.
148,rrbV8ftBig2hUVEKHFqjmQ,1,BurgerPalace in Springfield usually good.
148,rrbV8ftBig2hUVEKHFqjmQ,1,This one in Branson was the most disgusting food I have had.
148,rrbV8ftBig2hUVEKHFqjmQ,1,Had to send steak back for being burnt.
148,rrbV8ftBig2hUVEKHFqjmQ,1,Second one was tougher than shoe leather.
148,rrbV8ftBig2hUVEKHFqjmQ,1,New Orleans tilapia and shrimp was gross.
148,rrbV8ftBig2hUVEKHFqjmQ,1,Shrimp so small needed a magnifying glass to see it.
148,rrbV8ftBig2hUVEKHFqjmQ,1,Will NEVER eat there again!
149,ge-Bd2yiRdZSO3s9Noecyw,1,"Awful food, rude waitress, and messed up our entire order."
149,ge-Bd2yiRdZSO3s9Noecyw,1,Will never be back.
149,ge-Bd2yiRdZSO3s9Noecyw,1,Can go to McDonalds for better service.
150,co4iMlRqiXxqj9TUlBgipQ,2,"We usually like BurgerPalace really well, but this was a really disappointing experience at this restaurant."
150,co4iMlRqiXxqj9TUlBgipQ,2, We ordered the garden bar for our meal.
150,co4iMlRqiXxqj9TUlBgipQ,2, The lettuce was kinda slimy and some of it was brown.
150,co4iMlRqiXxqj9TUlBgipQ,2, The server was friendly but really rushes and there weren't all that many people there.
150,co4iMlRqiXxqj9TUlBgipQ,2, The only good part was the pretzel appetizer but nothing out of the ordinary.
150,co4iMlRqiXxqj9TUlBgipQ,2, Other BurgerPalace restaurants are much better.
151,K6HKO7ZpbIFkk_xnatjCSg,5,Traveling and stayed 2 nights in Dickson.
151,K6HKO7ZpbIFkk_xnatjCSg,5,Salad bar was clean and delicious.
151,K6HKO7ZpbIFkk_xnatjCSg,5,"Angie, the bartender, was awesome."
151,K6HKO7ZpbIFkk_xnatjCSg,5,We came back the 2nd day just because of her.
151,K6HKO7ZpbIFkk_xnatjCSg,5,She was friendly but not over the top.
151,K6HKO7ZpbIFkk_xnatjCSg,5,Angie was knowledgeable about the menu and drinks and she was very attentive.
151,K6HKO7ZpbIFkk_xnatjCSg,5,Thank you Angela for our great dining experiences.
151,K6HKO7ZpbIFkk_xnatjCSg,5,From Memphis and Nashville mom & daughter.
152,svTFVVm6ASqcDSZB-hdkIA,1,Really?
152,svTFVVm6ASqcDSZB-hdkIA,1,"Every picture, but 2,  is from the business owner?"
152,svTFVVm6ASqcDSZB-hdkIA,1,That tells me to not even try.
152,svTFVVm6ASqcDSZB-hdkIA,1,Good grief.
153,7EbV0dJDH8jiGbHxiFWVkw,3,I came here one evening for a night cap.
153,7EbV0dJDH8jiGbHxiFWVkw,3,The lady at the bar was nice and the drink was decent.
153,7EbV0dJDH8jiGbHxiFWVkw,3,"The place is just not very appealing to me, maybe to some, but for me, I find it gross, sticky and outdated."
153,7EbV0dJDH8jiGbHxiFWVkw,3,Their food selection isn't what I prefer either.
153,7EbV0dJDH8jiGbHxiFWVkw,3,"In fact, I wanted dessert, but all they had were heavy, big desserts."
153,7EbV0dJDH8jiGbHxiFWVkw,3,"Any way, I might stop in for a drink, but that's about it."
154,-nPzJcTXpQNFEvpqW9cakg,2,We were excited to try this place as we have seen many advertisements but never had one close enough to go to.
154,-nPzJcTXpQNFEvpqW9cakg,2, Since we were traveling we thought we would try them.
154,-nPzJcTXpQNFEvpqW9cakg,2,Server was good.
154,-nPzJcTXpQNFEvpqW9cakg,2, Food was okay.
154,-nPzJcTXpQNFEvpqW9cakg,2,We asked our server for the 2 for $22 menu but since we were there on a Tuesday they were not running the 2 for $22 menu as they had a special on all burgers and chicken sandwiches were $5.
154,-nPzJcTXpQNFEvpqW9cakg,2,   You would think they would still use that menu as I am sure there are other things than burgers on it.
154,-nPzJcTXpQNFEvpqW9cakg,2,I ordered a Honey Crunch Chicken and my husband got the Bacon Cheeseburger.
154,-nPzJcTXpQNFEvpqW9cakg,2,  For them not being very busy it took a while for our food to arrive.
154,-nPzJcTXpQNFEvpqW9cakg,2," But when it did, the tater tots were hot but my chicken sandwich was overcooked and a little dry."
154,-nPzJcTXpQNFEvpqW9cakg,2,  Asked for more honey mustard so I could get a little moisture into it.
154,-nPzJcTXpQNFEvpqW9cakg,2, The Bacon Cheeseburger was just that.
154,-nPzJcTXpQNFEvpqW9cakg,2," Bacon, cheese and meat."
154,-nPzJcTXpQNFEvpqW9cakg,2, Nothing special.
154,-nPzJcTXpQNFEvpqW9cakg,2,"Then when the bill arrived, my chicken sandwich was not on special as the server had said and the bacon cheese burger was rang in as a double cheese at $7."
154,-nPzJcTXpQNFEvpqW9cakg,2,"   If the server knew these were going to be more than the $5 she said, she should have mentioned that when she took the order."
154,-nPzJcTXpQNFEvpqW9cakg,2,  It is always best to be upfront with your customers than to hide things from them.
154,-nPzJcTXpQNFEvpqW9cakg,2,"Anyhow, we paid the bill and got back on the road."
154,-nPzJcTXpQNFEvpqW9cakg,2,Will we be back?
154,-nPzJcTXpQNFEvpqW9cakg,2, Probably to try it again.
154,-nPzJcTXpQNFEvpqW9cakg,2, They did have a salad bar that looked pretty good.
154,-nPzJcTXpQNFEvpqW9cakg,2, You don't see them very often so it would be a nice change.
155,b_Vwc6O0DDDBwm_x6RDiHA,1,Unless you are going for the salad bar it's hit or miss how your food and/or service will be.
155,b_Vwc6O0DDDBwm_x6RDiHA,1,I've given this place chance after chance after chance over the years and have been disappointed more times than pleased with the experience.
156,QdUQHg4AkFrKBlhybLzzLw,3,There are a lot of good restaurant choices in Dickson and this was not one.
156,QdUQHg4AkFrKBlhybLzzLw,3, 
156,QdUQHg4AkFrKBlhybLzzLw,3,"Not bad, but had the potential to be horrific!Easy to get to, lots of parking and staff was very friendly!  "
156,QdUQHg4AkFrKBlhybLzzLw,3,"Outside, the building was clean, well landscaped and welcoming."
156,QdUQHg4AkFrKBlhybLzzLw,3," If we stopped there, a true 4 or 5 star experience."
156,QdUQHg4AkFrKBlhybLzzLw,3,"As we were escorted to our table, there must have been 7 or 8 un-bussed tables in the area we were placed."
156,QdUQHg4AkFrKBlhybLzzLw,3,We were visited quickly by the waitstaff and drinks were on the table quickly.
156,QdUQHg4AkFrKBlhybLzzLw,3,"We both visited the restrooms, another bad idea as both Women's and Men were filthy!"
156,QdUQHg4AkFrKBlhybLzzLw,3,Staff were almost all wearing the masks under their chin.
156,QdUQHg4AkFrKBlhybLzzLw,3, (At least their chins were not potentially spreading COVID.)I ordered a side salad (trip to salad bar) and the bacon bourbon burger.
156,QdUQHg4AkFrKBlhybLzzLw,3," The salad bar had some COVID rules, but none of the customers followed (sanitize hands, wear gloves and mask)."
156,QdUQHg4AkFrKBlhybLzzLw,3, 
156,QdUQHg4AkFrKBlhybLzzLw,3,The salad bar was kind of messy and not well maintained.
156,QdUQHg4AkFrKBlhybLzzLw,3," The ingredients and options were decent and I made a mountain of salad my doctor would have been please to know I ate (less all the cheese, salad dressing and bacon)."
156,QdUQHg4AkFrKBlhybLzzLw,3," The burger was out quickly and although tasty, the meat was a little more on the very rare side."
156,QdUQHg4AkFrKBlhybLzzLw,3,"I might have heard a ""Mooo"" and tail swish on the first bite."
156,QdUQHg4AkFrKBlhybLzzLw,3,"As we had a chance to look around more, we noticed how the staff just wasn't cleaning up floors or tables."
156,QdUQHg4AkFrKBlhybLzzLw,3,We opted to leave and go elsewhere for dessert.
157,GAPVNupZkVgNlfb17PFGLQ,1,This is one of the dirtiest restaurants I've eaten at this year.
157,GAPVNupZkVgNlfb17PFGLQ,1,"Our waiter wore his mask under his chin, brushed his fingers under his nose (and didn't wash his hands)."
157,GAPVNupZkVgNlfb17PFGLQ,1,"Salad bar plates were iffy, restaurant floor was sticky, and a glimpse of the kitchen floor was really scary."
157,GAPVNupZkVgNlfb17PFGLQ,1,Margaritas were ghastly.
157,GAPVNupZkVgNlfb17PFGLQ,1,Food pretty greasy.
157,GAPVNupZkVgNlfb17PFGLQ,1,The salad bar was OK.
157,GAPVNupZkVgNlfb17PFGLQ,1,I'd opt for other options in Dickson.
158,rnKjTOme3X2vK2q_uJX0ow,5,"I travel here regularly for work and I have had mixed feelings about coming here due to some of the reviews I read, however I decided to give it a try tonight."
158,rnKjTOme3X2vK2q_uJX0ow,5,"I had great service, quick and my food was great!"
158,rnKjTOme3X2vK2q_uJX0ow,5,The only thing that could have been better was my loaded mashed potatoes.
158,rnKjTOme3X2vK2q_uJX0ow,5,I knew from the minute she brought them there would be an issue.
158,rnKjTOme3X2vK2q_uJX0ow,5,They use super cold butter on top along with the cold sour cream I knew I needed to remove the butter before it made the potatoes cold.
158,rnKjTOme3X2vK2q_uJX0ow,5,I had the bacon bourbon sirloin loaded mashed and rice.
158,rnKjTOme3X2vK2q_uJX0ow,5,Everything was amazing!
159,mnn4c3DsrQA75y8EakcWhA,2,"disappointed to go to this restaurant, the terrible attention had an unpleasant smelljust ordering some drinks since we were there"
160,W--3KUyfXvt1PqPlIGsrEA,1,"Very unpleasant experience, will never come back to this town to stay during my vacation ever again."
160,W--3KUyfXvt1PqPlIGsrEA,1,10/10 do not recommend.
160,W--3KUyfXvt1PqPlIGsrEA,1,"Waitress was fabulous, the others were completely out of line, and condescending."
160,W--3KUyfXvt1PqPlIGsrEA,1,"Waitress had to ""go get fries"" from walmart down the road because they were running out."
161,weBahZf0oSqJIGfqNGOenQ,1,Hostess lied to us.
161,weBahZf0oSqJIGfqNGOenQ,1,Told us it would be a 15-20 minute wait.
161,weBahZf0oSqJIGfqNGOenQ,1,Then after waiting 20 minutes when we asked how long the wait would be we were told the kitchen was backed up and they couldn't tell us how long the wait would be.
161,weBahZf0oSqJIGfqNGOenQ,1,This on a night when there were less than 10 tables occupied when we came in.
161,weBahZf0oSqJIGfqNGOenQ,1,We understand that these things happen but don't lie to your customers.
162,QHbOCIv837zevIm701e7sQ,2,"The server was spectacular, though significantly over worked."
162,QHbOCIv837zevIm701e7sQ,2,"She took orders, served food and drinks, bussed tables while sanitizing, checking her sections(obviously understaffed) and got groups bills while attending multiple tables in an entire giant section."
162,QHbOCIv837zevIm701e7sQ,2,5 stars to
162,QHbOCIv837zevIm701e7sQ,2,her!!The
162,QHbOCIv837zevIm701e7sQ,2,food sucked.
162,QHbOCIv837zevIm701e7sQ,2,The management and general cleanliness was terrible.
162,QHbOCIv837zevIm701e7sQ,2,"My soggy chicken Caesar salad was burnt on one side, barely cooked on the other."
162,QHbOCIv837zevIm701e7sQ,2,Shameful.
162,QHbOCIv837zevIm701e7sQ,2,The artichoke dip was glistening with oil and Luke warm
162,QHbOCIv837zevIm701e7sQ,2,.
162,QHbOCIv837zevIm701e7sQ,2,Chips were fine.
162,QHbOCIv837zevIm701e7sQ,2,"Took a few bites, didn't bother asking for a redo, because that would have probably taken another 45 minutes."
162,QHbOCIv837zevIm701e7sQ,2,"Tipped her 40 percent for her great job, in cash, because she was the only reason for 2 stars."
162,QHbOCIv837zevIm701e7sQ,2,This BurgerPalace is in serious need of..... idk? Competition! Or . Whatever.
162,QHbOCIv837zevIm701e7sQ,2,"Avoid this place unless you live on Arby's and McDonald's, otherwise, this is 5 star dining for you."
163,ANxBh8nvNy-NTeYkUQNSoQ,1,I dont know what happened to this place between the time I moved here two years ago and friday April 17th 2020 but the quality of food has gone completely down hill.
163,ANxBh8nvNy-NTeYkUQNSoQ,1,"The mashed potatoes were dry and flavorless, both the 12oz rib eye and the 6oz sirloin were over cook and looked greasy by the time I opened them from our to go boxes."
163,ANxBh8nvNy-NTeYkUQNSoQ,1,The burgers had cold melted cheese like it had been sitting for longer than 5 minutes and the fries were not fresh.
163,ANxBh8nvNy-NTeYkUQNSoQ,1,The only saving grace of the whole thing was the pineapple upside down cake.
163,ANxBh8nvNy-NTeYkUQNSoQ,1,"If a person gives you a set time to pick it up, it should be made just slightly before they arrive, not a while before they arrive and made to sit."
163,ANxBh8nvNy-NTeYkUQNSoQ,1,"Also I get social distancing, but you need more than one server out in the lot checking on people, also someone to pick up the phone."
163,ANxBh8nvNy-NTeYkUQNSoQ,1,I shouldn't have to call 26 times with no answer and sometimes a busy signal before having to drive there and hope I can catch the only guy working the lot.
163,ANxBh8nvNy-NTeYkUQNSoQ,1,"Furthermore beyond the quality of food being terrible, the 6oz. sirloin was not even with my order when I picked it up."
163,ANxBh8nvNy-NTeYkUQNSoQ,1,"But the look of the food, that was well before I even went back to get my dang dinner."
163,ANxBh8nvNy-NTeYkUQNSoQ,1,Next time I'll just go to mcds and get some hot fresh food.
164,znXjYOQL7HCEU3kdwma7Xg,5,If you're ever in a layover from Newark or a cancelled/delayed flight.
164,znXjYOQL7HCEU3kdwma7Xg,5,Chances are the hotel will be in the Elizabeth town area which is close to the airport.
164,znXjYOQL7HCEU3kdwma7Xg,5,There's a mall but close by there's an ihop and a BurgerPalace
164,znXjYOQL7HCEU3kdwma7Xg,5,"Now, it's been ages since I've stepped foot into one but have been here twice over the last few months."
164,znXjYOQL7HCEU3kdwma7Xg,5,I had remembered our server from the first time Nehemi and had the pleasure of seeing him again today.
164,znXjYOQL7HCEU3kdwma7Xg,5,"He's wonderful, checks up on us timely, and tells is straight when it comes to the food."
164,znXjYOQL7HCEU3kdwma7Xg,5,"The food is surprisingly tasty and have had the chicken, ribs, and onion rings."
164,znXjYOQL7HCEU3kdwma7Xg,5,Definitely would come back and they got a veggie burger for you veggies out there.
164,znXjYOQL7HCEU3kdwma7Xg,5,Revamped menu that you need to check it out.
164,znXjYOQL7HCEU3kdwma7Xg,5,Thanks Nehemi!
165,cVQ-Ld8GfRtC9NvdUcTYMg,4,Mike the bartender made my last two nights here great.
165,cVQ-Ld8GfRtC9NvdUcTYMg,4,"I was here for business and had never been in NJ, everything was clean and food was delicious."
165,cVQ-Ld8GfRtC9NvdUcTYMg,4,I wouldn't recommend the broccoli cheddar as that was watery and salty but service was amazing and the rib eye and salad bar on point
166,q67uyLcRN_LNku0YV7vUsA,4,It was close and good basic food.
166,q67uyLcRN_LNku0YV7vUsA,4,Service was good amd drinks were cold.
166,q67uyLcRN_LNku0YV7vUsA,4,I would go back as it was as expected.
167,RCLR9RpbpCc1am2_1bamkQ,5,My daughter and I love BurgerPalace My favorite entree is the hickory bourbon chicken with two sides.
167,RCLR9RpbpCc1am2_1bamkQ,5,I have never been disappointed and always received incredible service.
167,RCLR9RpbpCc1am2_1bamkQ,5,They have tasty cocktails too.
168,KdGfHJe-WuRO-Xov9_60ug,1,Please don't come here expecting quality service.
168,KdGfHJe-WuRO-Xov9_60ug,1,Why be in the service industry if you aren't a people person or have an attitude?
168,KdGfHJe-WuRO-Xov9_60ug,1,It's very hostile and never experienced this at a chain restaurant
169,pn0fUmZZWn8UepBpGM4tGg,1,I have not been to a BurgerPalace in quite a while and thought a burger might be a good idea...
169,pn0fUmZZWn8UepBpGM4tGg,1,WRONG!!
169,pn0fUmZZWn8UepBpGM4tGg,1, This was most probably the worst burger I have ever seen....
169,pn0fUmZZWn8UepBpGM4tGg,1,"I just couldn't eat it, the fries was cold and old, the burger looked like someone sat on it!"
169,pn0fUmZZWn8UepBpGM4tGg,1,Sorry to say but now I understand why they have a sign on the door for cooks!
169,pn0fUmZZWn8UepBpGM4tGg,1,They will NEVER see me again!
170,nH74GPUsEfV50lIL7mytaA,5,Everything was very good!!
170,nH74GPUsEfV50lIL7mytaA,5,And the services very nice too and It is near to Newark airport
171,Vck8CvOpy8cuJBwldLXXwQ,5,Great service by Mike and team tonight!
171,Vck8CvOpy8cuJBwldLXXwQ,5, 
171,Vck8CvOpy8cuJBwldLXXwQ,5,Cheers to you Mike!
171,Vck8CvOpy8cuJBwldLXXwQ,5,Thanks for the vibes.
171,Vck8CvOpy8cuJBwldLXXwQ,5, I'll be back.
172,YPY7cUvcVidaLoSpmUcmRg,1,It's understandable that the restaurant cannot run their salad bar.
172,YPY7cUvcVidaLoSpmUcmRg,1, Even though I was excited about it I get it.
172,YPY7cUvcVidaLoSpmUcmRg,1, However my meal there was severely lacking.
172,YPY7cUvcVidaLoSpmUcmRg,1, My drink glass was filthy enough I didn't bother ordering another because I didn't trust the cleaning methods anyway.
172,YPY7cUvcVidaLoSpmUcmRg,1, The chicken burger was 80% breading.
172,YPY7cUvcVidaLoSpmUcmRg,1, Dry.
172,YPY7cUvcVidaLoSpmUcmRg,1, Just not good.
172,YPY7cUvcVidaLoSpmUcmRg,1, The onion rings fit the same description.
172,YPY7cUvcVidaLoSpmUcmRg,1,  I used to enjoy BurgerPalace night hen they were in the Portland area.
172,YPY7cUvcVidaLoSpmUcmRg,1, I think I just ate my last meal at the chain however.
173,gXct1VdJ1vYLMXpFFJv7SQ,1,"I walked into the restaurant and I found the greeter seating in the waiting area, seat's, I asked for table and was told no tables were available, but I could go to the bar area."
173,gXct1VdJ1vYLMXpFFJv7SQ,1, I went to the bar area where there was tables available in the bar area with people seating at the tables and at bar.
173,gXct1VdJ1vYLMXpFFJv7SQ,1," So I took a seat at a table to only get chastise for sitting at a table from the greeter, I'm 60 y/o & brown color and greeter is about 18 y/o she was brown of color also was rude to me."
173,gXct1VdJ1vYLMXpFFJv7SQ,1, I noticed the majority of the restaurant was white and all the brown people who entered the restaurant were given the option to sit at the bar to order their food to go.
173,gXct1VdJ1vYLMXpFFJv7SQ,1," That greeter waited on me, slammed my plate on the table without any eating utensil's and napkins."
173,gXct1VdJ1vYLMXpFFJv7SQ,1, I was rushed to pay bill before asking me if I wanted any desert.
173,gXct1VdJ1vYLMXpFFJv7SQ,1, I would not go back ever!!!
174,ZntwIkJggeVwupjs75fSEA,1,"Good business model... no air condition, making the place incredibly hot and charge money for water."
174,ZntwIkJggeVwupjs75fSEA,1,"Reminds me of the 60's, but with over priced beer 13 dollars for a plastic cup."
174,ZntwIkJggeVwupjs75fSEA,1,"I don't expect much from an airport ruby tuesdays, but this is below expectations."
174,ZntwIkJggeVwupjs75fSEA,1,We need a new airport.
174,ZntwIkJggeVwupjs75fSEA,1,I feel bad for the people working at this establishment.
175,5--ABdg3l6JVO9yqzCY0IQ,1,"BurgerPalace should be ashamed of themselves for the ham, cheese and egg breakfast sandwich they serve."
175,5--ABdg3l6JVO9yqzCY0IQ,1,"Everyone knows and expects airport prices to be higher but $13.49 for scrambled eggs, a little cheese and 1 thin slice of sandwich meat for the ham!?!"
175,5--ABdg3l6JVO9yqzCY0IQ,1,Come on!!!
175,5--ABdg3l6JVO9yqzCY0IQ,1,"Reading the menu, I was thinking, nice, breakfast potatoes.....don't be fooled like me - they are just French fries."
175,5--ABdg3l6JVO9yqzCY0IQ,1,Will not be going back when I am in the Newark airport - go to the seafood place that actually has a real kitchen.
176,sOTeTIh6tvNZnT4dg8uVlQ,1,"This is a scam of a ""restaurant."""
176,sOTeTIh6tvNZnT4dg8uVlQ,1,We asked for water thinking we would get glasses but instead we got bottled water for $4/each.
176,sOTeTIh6tvNZnT4dg8uVlQ,1,The waitress should have informed us this was bottled and the cost.
176,sOTeTIh6tvNZnT4dg8uVlQ,1,$12 for 4 disgusting mozzarella sticks and $17 for 4 chicken fingers with fries.
176,sOTeTIh6tvNZnT4dg8uVlQ,1,"Also, $12.50 for a blue moon."
176,sOTeTIh6tvNZnT4dg8uVlQ,1,"Cost was outrageous, spend your money at the smaller marketplaces."
176,sOTeTIh6tvNZnT4dg8uVlQ,1,Horrendous service too.
176,sOTeTIh6tvNZnT4dg8uVlQ,1,My husband and I made an agreement to never return to this restaurant chain ever again.
177,APr8q-orGEstdlafTCjMWQ,1,Our flight was delayed and we needed to eat so we stopped in here for some dinner and a drink .
177,APr8q-orGEstdlafTCjMWQ,1,2 Rum and Cokes were 35.00 and we ordered a chicken finger platter that was awful the fries were soggy and the chicken fingers tasted freezer burnt.
177,APr8q-orGEstdlafTCjMWQ,1,The server attempted to charge us for 3 drinks instead of 2.
177,APr8q-orGEstdlafTCjMWQ,1,We had her fix it once we pointed it out to her.
177,APr8q-orGEstdlafTCjMWQ,1,Pricing was extremely high for the service and quality that was provided
178,B-pHARPOGmeXdkGjbjoiLw,1,So here are the cliff notes.
178,B-pHARPOGmeXdkGjbjoiLw,1,Bad serviceLazyNo personalityGave them $20  for change to tip.
178,B-pHARPOGmeXdkGjbjoiLw,1,Gave me 4 $5 bills.
178,B-pHARPOGmeXdkGjbjoiLw,1,Which meant i want a 5 tip on 15 meal.
178,B-pHARPOGmeXdkGjbjoiLw,1,She got huffy and said no dollar bills.
178,B-pHARPOGmeXdkGjbjoiLw,1,Nice try.
178,B-pHARPOGmeXdkGjbjoiLw,1,No guilt.
179,z4KbsItECkFosMvNa9OovA,2,Absolutely no care to sanitize a table after the last customer..
179,z4KbsItECkFosMvNa9OovA,2,Food is decent.
179,z4KbsItECkFosMvNa9OovA,2,Three items on the lunch entree menu.
179,z4KbsItECkFosMvNa9OovA,2,So so customer service
180,3NcjX-xkAQEtChpfMjnGIQ,1,This Place sucksssss.
180,3NcjX-xkAQEtChpfMjnGIQ,1,The waitress didn't write down my order.
180,3NcjX-xkAQEtChpfMjnGIQ,1,Guess what happened.
180,3NcjX-xkAQEtChpfMjnGIQ,1,I didn't get my entire order and I was in a time crunch for my flight.
180,3NcjX-xkAQEtChpfMjnGIQ,1,"You have to buy bottle water, that is $3.50.."
180,3NcjX-xkAQEtChpfMjnGIQ,1,their menu is trash.
180,3NcjX-xkAQEtChpfMjnGIQ,1,Even if you dine in you have to eat out of a styrofoam container.
181,7b8KgdiMZ5hbawfA5NRujw,2,Their menu was very limited and wasn't even fresh.
181,7b8KgdiMZ5hbawfA5NRujw,2,The drink menu was also limited and they did not have a large assortment liquor.
181,7b8KgdiMZ5hbawfA5NRujw,2,The staff was nice and doing the best they could.
182,DCxVrYVR55o-q4e8BRZzjw,1,Avoid this place.
182,DCxVrYVR55o-q4e8BRZzjw,1,I was charged $12.26 for a plastic cup of Coors Light.
182,DCxVrYVR55o-q4e8BRZzjw,1,This is just ridiculous.
182,DCxVrYVR55o-q4e8BRZzjw,1,And unless I was getting food I wasn't allowed to get a table since bar seats were taken so I had to drink it outside.
182,DCxVrYVR55o-q4e8BRZzjw,1,There's another bar on this terminal (Phillips) which is also ultra expensive but at least you can have a seat and enjoy your pricey beer.
183,1a3H2v3tF7YcLXc5Zq7DFw,1,Menus small probably cause of covid but doesn't give the blonde female server an excuse to be rude to customers.
183,1a3H2v3tF7YcLXc5Zq7DFw,1,She came over and asked me to pay quicker because I was taking too long to get my money out.
183,1a3H2v3tF7YcLXc5Zq7DFw,1,While not bothering other customers who had been there longer than me.
183,1a3H2v3tF7YcLXc5Zq7DFw,1,Her excuse was each table was only allowed 20 minutes like what a joke.
183,1a3H2v3tF7YcLXc5Zq7DFw,1,Hope she likes bad tips cause that's not how you treat customers.
183,1a3H2v3tF7YcLXc5Zq7DFw,1,I Can't believe she still has a job in customer service.
184,DPG5tcfboo3WwQFEqH-7yg,1,I've flown out of and into numerous airports across the nation and world.
184,DPG5tcfboo3WwQFEqH-7yg,1,"So-so food is anticipated at airports, but this place was atrocious."
184,DPG5tcfboo3WwQFEqH-7yg,1,"My boyfriend made the mistake of not hanging his bag up when eating (just placed by his chair), and now it is soiled with heavy grease stains."
184,DPG5tcfboo3WwQFEqH-7yg,1,This is not to say that grease isn't inevitable.
184,DPG5tcfboo3WwQFEqH-7yg,1,"However, this floor was FILTHY."
184,DPG5tcfboo3WwQFEqH-7yg,1,"Grease and liquid were very visible on the floor during PEAK hours, around 6:30 PM on a Sunday."
184,DPG5tcfboo3WwQFEqH-7yg,1,"If you have any sort of expectations, lower them immediately."
184,DPG5tcfboo3WwQFEqH-7yg,1,It's the kind of place where you visit and feel you need to shower.
184,DPG5tcfboo3WwQFEqH-7yg,1,This place is a lawsuit waiting to happen.
184,DPG5tcfboo3WwQFEqH-7yg,1,I just hope they get reported by the health department before anyone gets injured.
185,t1EnMvBVZ4AKerRRQSOZJg,2,The food is good if your really hungry!
185,t1EnMvBVZ4AKerRRQSOZJg,2,Chicken tenders did their job.
185,t1EnMvBVZ4AKerRRQSOZJg,2,But since when do you come and demand payment while the customer is still eating?!?!?!
185,t1EnMvBVZ4AKerRRQSOZJg,2,Very rude of the older Indian man to come and demand the card to charge while we were literally still eating
186,sB8zUr_mS-xJYIl7t3wS2w,1,"My wife and I were flying out of Newark, got to gate at 8pm and looked for someplace to eat."
186,sB8zUr_mS-xJYIl7t3wS2w,1," Found BurgerPalace near gate 30 terminal A,  the place was nearly empty so we sat down at a table for 4, we were promptly told that we had to sit at a table for two, again the place was empty."
186,sB8zUr_mS-xJYIl7t3wS2w,1," We told the persons that we needed room for luggage and coats, again we were told to sit at a table for 2!"
186,sB8zUr_mS-xJYIl7t3wS2w,1," We left, not hurrying back for that type of customer service"
187,5cooIsJCmvDmOkZlRQSPog,2,"Stopped in for a late lunch, and even though only a few customers, it took quite a to get waited on."
187,5cooIsJCmvDmOkZlRQSPog,2,They were out of most of their draft beers.
187,5cooIsJCmvDmOkZlRQSPog,2,"Food was okay, but nothing special for the price."
187,5cooIsJCmvDmOkZlRQSPog,2,"I had the bourbon salmon, and my guest had ribs and shrimp."
187,5cooIsJCmvDmOkZlRQSPog,2,Lots of fries though!
187,5cooIsJCmvDmOkZlRQSPog,2,Lol!
187,5cooIsJCmvDmOkZlRQSPog,2,"Server was rude, unfriendly and slow!"
187,5cooIsJCmvDmOkZlRQSPog,2,Too many excellent restaurants in this area to give Ruby's another chance.
187,5cooIsJCmvDmOkZlRQSPog,2,Sorry!

188,Lb5PRGumIFhDw7dcfmN22Q,4,It does seem under staffed but the staff that is here is killin it.
188,Lb5PRGumIFhDw7dcfmN22Q,4,The salad bar is ice cold and the croutons are warm.
188,Lb5PRGumIFhDw7dcfmN22Q,4,I come here after eating poorly for a bit and crush a few salads.

189,Q4V3u2A--PmeOjmzptGNTQ,4,"Service was great, salad bar is now $4.99 extra as it used to be available as one of your sides, not now but I understand:(My chicken tenders came out a little well done, the loaded fries I didn't care for, they had queso cheese, shredded cheese , bacon and chives."
189,Q4V3u2A--PmeOjmzptGNTQ,4,Next time I will ask to either keep queso off because as it got cold it got

190,nEpzZa84zluXpc3j8zTaug,4,We hadn't been in for a while and they have a new menu.
190,nEpzZa84zluXpc3j8zTaug,4,"Tried the chicken carbonara, loved the mix of veggies, tasty sauce and bacon."
190,nEpzZa84zluXpc3j8zTaug,4,Good and friendly service.
190,nEpzZa84zluXpc3j8zTaug,4,"I don't know why they don't do something about the bathrooms, there is no excuse for it to be so cold, it has been that way for years."
190,nEpzZa84zluXpc3j8zTaug,4,So cold the handsoap even felt cold in hands.
191,ftbh-le7MHOXTBlvdyG0Nw,2,so so t get me wrong.
191,ftbh-le7MHOXTBlvdyG0Nw,2,food was hot and had good flavor.
191,ftbh-le7MHOXTBlvdyG0Nw,2,how a restaurant can survive with 3 staff and not seat us due to kitchen prioritizing take out over dine in.
191,ftbh-le7MHOXTBlvdyG0Nw,2,not the best for customer service so again we will vote with our feet.
192,ZxH23_bGW9d4XqPGM33O5g,1,Super busy and way understaffed.
192,ZxH23_bGW9d4XqPGM33O5g,1,Waited 20 minutes for a table.
192,ZxH23_bGW9d4XqPGM33O5g,1,Even though they were pushy the waitress took care of us in a timely manner.
192,ZxH23_bGW9d4XqPGM33O5g,1,Ordered the PULLED BBQ PORK.
192,ZxH23_bGW9d4XqPGM33O5g,1,It was tough or old and chewy.
192,ZxH23_bGW9d4XqPGM33O5g,1,In addition I t was not PULLED it was cut cubes.
192,ZxH23_bGW9d4XqPGM33O5g,1,When I mentioned this to the waitress all she did was apologize and say she'd pass it on to the cook.
192,ZxH23_bGW9d4XqPGM33O5g,1,"No discount of any type, not even an offer to exchange it."
192,ZxH23_bGW9d4XqPGM33O5g,1,I understand being both busy and short staffed but to not to offer anything for the food that was not as ordered nor fresh is almost insulting...
192,ZxH23_bGW9d4XqPGM33O5g,1,lime we only want your money we don't care if the food is right.
193,EYeAffRoiHDrIfquNJXBCA,1,Came for lunch but the doors were locked.
193,EYeAffRoiHDrIfquNJXBCA,1,Stood there for a minute and decided to call since there was no sign as to why they are not open.
193,EYeAffRoiHDrIfquNJXBCA,1,Lady told me they didn't have power and didn't know when they'd be open.
193,EYeAffRoiHDrIfquNJXBCA,1,I wish they'd have some courtesy and put a sign on the door and/or update their website.
193,EYeAffRoiHDrIfquNJXBCA,1,A couple of cars pulled up and I told them the situation.
193,EYeAffRoiHDrIfquNJXBCA,1,They weren't happy either.
193,EYeAffRoiHDrIfquNJXBCA,1,One couple said they came from around 86th street.
193,EYeAffRoiHDrIfquNJXBCA,1,What a waste of time.
194,GbASkjFDnD1Ogb8LrLpskg,3,THE GARDEN BAR IS OPEN!!!!
194,GbASkjFDnD1Ogb8LrLpskg,3,"So happy I went to my favorite chain restaurant for their ""5$ burger and fries or tots"" Marketing email!"
194,GbASkjFDnD1Ogb8LrLpskg,3,"Five bucks for a mediocre burger and fries, but added the Garden Bar for $4.99 (SO DELICIOUS!)"
194,GbASkjFDnD1Ogb8LrLpskg,3,"The garden bar is my only RT obsession, everything else is, well...mediocre."
194,GbASkjFDnD1Ogb8LrLpskg,3,Don't judge me!
195,_C0lh6_J5N1V3yaL_ySwkw,1,Asked for a medium-rare hamburger and received this.
195,_C0lh6_J5N1V3yaL_ySwkw,1,Completely raw on the inside and still cold!
195,_C0lh6_J5N1V3yaL_ySwkw,1,"I'm so disappointed, won't be eating here ever again."
196,SSGKRmSE9LM_uFq1aiGplw,3,Usually good food and service.
196,SSGKRmSE9LM_uFq1aiGplw,3,Today my mother's chicken had a piece of plastic in the sauce.
196,SSGKRmSE9LM_uFq1aiGplw,3,It looked like a tab from a bread bag.
196,SSGKRmSE9LM_uFq1aiGplw,3,"She got the ribs and they were a little dry, but ok."
196,SSGKRmSE9LM_uFq1aiGplw,3,The place had no one in it when we arrived.
196,SSGKRmSE9LM_uFq1aiGplw,3,"Where we set, the floor was sticky, our shoes stuck to it."
196,SSGKRmSE9LM_uFq1aiGplw,3,There was a few pieces of food  on the floor.
196,SSGKRmSE9LM_uFq1aiGplw,3,I figured being almost 5pm and no one here they place would be cleaner.
197,IgP5djdnc9V8X8u9-Ki7dA,2,Frankly was disappointed.
197,IgP5djdnc9V8X8u9-Ki7dA,2,"We came out to celebrate a birthday, looked forward to taking family out to dinner."
197,IgP5djdnc9V8X8u9-Ki7dA,2,"We ordered, we waited close to an hour for the food to be delivered to the table."
197,IgP5djdnc9V8X8u9-Ki7dA,2,"I ordered my ribeye medium rare, came to the table well done."
197,IgP5djdnc9V8X8u9-Ki7dA,2,"We ordered 3 ribeyes, all well done."
197,IgP5djdnc9V8X8u9-Ki7dA,2,"Told the staff about my steak, and the other 2 rib eyes, nothing was done to correct it."
197,IgP5djdnc9V8X8u9-Ki7dA,2,I use to love coming here with family.
197,IgP5djdnc9V8X8u9-Ki7dA,2,Staff was friendly at least but very short staffed.
197,IgP5djdnc9V8X8u9-Ki7dA,2,Hope things change
198,X2Tndbo-W0Ik7eJLRICUbQ,1,"Okay, so first i go to the garden bar (as they call it) and there were ABSOLUTELY ZERO PLATES."
198,X2Tndbo-W0Ik7eJLRICUbQ,1,There were 8 employees watching as I was waiting and i still had to ask them.
198,X2Tndbo-W0Ik7eJLRICUbQ,1,"After my first time going up and them having no plates, i went a second time, THEY HAD NO FRUIT."
198,X2Tndbo-W0Ik7eJLRICUbQ,1,"My child is 250 pounds (he is only 7) and on a strict fruit diet, so he didn't get to eat."
198,X2Tndbo-W0Ik7eJLRICUbQ,1,I've had better food at Chuck e. cheese.
198,X2Tndbo-W0Ik7eJLRICUbQ,1,My experience here was bad and i hated the bar.
198,X2Tndbo-W0Ik7eJLRICUbQ,1,Our waiter was really nice though 2/10 Experience
199,kHrtot5TKZmxq0gtnbK7-w,1,The salad bar was not at all full.
199,kHrtot5TKZmxq0gtnbK7-w,1,Many things were missing.
199,kHrtot5TKZmxq0gtnbK7-w,1,Service was good food was eh.
199,kHrtot5TKZmxq0gtnbK7-w,1,I don't know if i recommend there was no pasta and no fruit.
200,p26V3qG1E_cDW_kFR3qBog,2,Stopped at 5pm on a Sunday wasn't busy didn't get food for an hour.
200,p26V3qG1E_cDW_kFR3qBog,2, When waitress brought food she said they got 2 large grub hub orders that's what took so long.
200,p26V3qG1E_cDW_kFR3qBog,2, Not sure when grub hub took president over in-person customers.
201,pOFJ1bP7yX_LL3UEYNX38Q,5,My Favorite place to take my date/wife.
201,pOFJ1bP7yX_LL3UEYNX38Q,5,The salad bar is awesome with its numerous choices!
202,cipWOfSfIJE8LAGOgzspJg,1,Jeez.
202,cipWOfSfIJE8LAGOgzspJg,1,This is the third time in this town I've order a steak Med rare.
202,cipWOfSfIJE8LAGOgzspJg,1,And the third time I've been served a steak that's well done.
202,cipWOfSfIJE8LAGOgzspJg,1,It sure makes my yorkies happy.
202,cipWOfSfIJE8LAGOgzspJg,1,Because I can't eat it.
203,GbVq3-ss2G-QfHwjm7MGpQ,5,"Quality of food, and quality of service we're excellent!"
203,GbVq3-ss2G-QfHwjm7MGpQ,5,We thoroughly enjoyed our visit.
203,GbVq3-ss2G-QfHwjm7MGpQ,5,I wish our BurgerPalace didn't close up like they did!
204,M9pw8tLzbGWIolN6Y5LbTw,3,Stopped in on a road trip.
204,M9pw8tLzbGWIolN6Y5LbTw,3, Ordered ribs which were very good.
204,M9pw8tLzbGWIolN6Y5LbTw,3, The coleslaw was soggggy and old.
204,M9pw8tLzbGWIolN6Y5LbTw,3,The salad was yesterdays too.
204,M9pw8tLzbGWIolN6Y5LbTw,3, The ribeye while cooked to order had a lot of fat.
204,M9pw8tLzbGWIolN6Y5LbTw,3,The fried shrimp while crispy were the tiniest shrimp I've seen.
204,M9pw8tLzbGWIolN6Y5LbTw,3,"  Our server was great, personable and came round as needed."
204,M9pw8tLzbGWIolN6Y5LbTw,3,The cocktails were on point.

206,Pp5gPrNwPwLym_jnVmdzig,5,We're from Pittsburgh & were in the area so decided to stop for dinner.
206,Pp5gPrNwPwLym_jnVmdzig,5,"I had been to a BurgerPalace many times years ago but when I went to one in Baltimore a couple years ago with my husband (his first time), he wondered why I spoke so highly of the restaurant because that one was horrendous."
206,Pp5gPrNwPwLym_jnVmdzig,5,We decided to check this location out just because why not?
206,Pp5gPrNwPwLym_jnVmdzig,5,We were VERY satisfied.
206,Pp5gPrNwPwLym_jnVmdzig,5,The service was impeccable.
206,Pp5gPrNwPwLym_jnVmdzig,5,"I got the garden bar & by the time I returned to my seat, my husband's entree had already arrived!"
206,Pp5gPrNwPwLym_jnVmdzig,5,"Fast, delicious food & the prices don't break the bank."
206,Pp5gPrNwPwLym_jnVmdzig,5,We will for sure be back when we're in the area again!
207,xuyABffC5lc0t3_t3ZVSUg,2,"Food was not fresh , taste like everything was just frozen and they threw it in the microwave"
208,Qz6OXG5lJ5UnmPHQiswKrg,1,Do not care for the food at this business!
208,Qz6OXG5lJ5UnmPHQiswKrg,1,"Greasy, unhealthy, and poor selection!"
208,Qz6OXG5lJ5UnmPHQiswKrg,1,Hardly visit this business as I feel sick and thirsty after a meal there!
208,Qz6OXG5lJ5UnmPHQiswKrg,1,I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone unless u wanted to stop in just for a drink!
209,pReI_iUWMxpGnlRRhgJhkA,1,I ordered for pickup expecting it to be ready as the app started!

209,pReI_iUWMxpGnlRRhgJhkA,1,Get it together
210,-48Au3LoYP4Cs3qVmVAwww,1,Well that's a bummer.
210,-48Au3LoYP4Cs3qVmVAwww,1,We used to enjoy RT's but it seems like the whole thing has been going downhill for the last few years.
210,-48Au3LoYP4Cs3qVmVAwww,1,Well tonight (Valentine's Day) we were looking forward to their food.
210,-48Au3LoYP4Cs3qVmVAwww,1,"I called to place an order at 4:45pm, which seemed a safe bet as it wasn't the busiest part of the dinner hour."
210,-48Au3LoYP4Cs3qVmVAwww,1,I was put on hold for over 6 minutes.
210,-48Au3LoYP4Cs3qVmVAwww,1,I finally hung up (assuming I'd been forgotten)
210,-48Au3LoYP4Cs3qVmVAwww,1,and
210,-48Au3LoYP4Cs3qVmVAwww,1,called again.
210,-48Au3LoYP4Cs3qVmVAwww,1,"When I was told I'd be put on hold I let them know I'd just been on hold for over 6 minutes, and asked if it was very busy as I didn't want to wait that long again."
210,-48Au3LoYP4Cs3qVmVAwww,1,"They said they thought it was probably pretty busy ""over there"" and they would try to get me connected faster (no apology)."
210,-48Au3LoYP4Cs3qVmVAwww,1,When they went to transfer my call they hung up on me.
210,-48Au3LoYP4Cs3qVmVAwww,1,We ended up ordering from a different business.
211,_qilh625iTw0MMMXy5PeEQ,2,We bought special burgers.
211,_qilh625iTw0MMMXy5PeEQ,2, Looked like they put a slider on a bun 2x the size.
211,_qilh625iTw0MMMXy5PeEQ,2," What a waste!  Won,t be getting food from there again.  And 5 meals that they took no care with."
211,_qilh625iTw0MMMXy5PeEQ,2, Everything slide around and not by us.
212,_BACzVL3PW_IRKVq-N_7KQ,1,Worst brisket I have ever had.
212,_BACzVL3PW_IRKVq-N_7KQ,1,Employees just sitting around the bar!
212,_BACzVL3PW_IRKVq-N_7KQ,1,I won't be back unless I want a salad.
213,uSpg7uu9Wj7Z-uJpaGukEA,5,One of the only places that has an amazing salad bar.
213,uSpg7uu9Wj7Z-uJpaGukEA,5,Lots of different food to choose from . Truly
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,"Have you ever wanted to experience the feeling of eating out at such a nasty restaurant, you'll wish they gave you a z-pack with your check after the meal?"
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,"If so, you should head on down to BurgerPalace in Elyria!Stopped"
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,in here
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,with my mom
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,recently
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,.
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,The parking lot had more potholes than there are holes in your average slice of Swiss cheese.
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,A sign we missed of the horrors awaiting us inside...
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,"Walking in, the front waiting area smelled strongly of ribs and barbecue sauce...to the point where it was nauseating."
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,(How is that even possible?!)
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,"Once seated, I noticed the table next to us needed cleaning underneath."
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,Looked like the patrons used Parmesan cheese as confetti.
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,The smashed particles look...gross.
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,The atmosphere is interesting.
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,I'm not sure what direction they were going for.
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,"It was like the 80s, 90s, and 00s threw up in there--and not the more stylish parts."
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,I totally forgot they made plastic table cloths with felt on the underside.
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,Haven't seen one of those babies since 2003!
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,Adding to the ambiance were unruly children and grown men loudly blowing their nose.
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,(This happens anywhere.)The
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,food was lackluster at best.
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,"My soup spoon was sticky on the underside, and I noticed after eating it that the crackers I was given were recycled from another patron...the wrapper had dried soup on them that was NOT mine."
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,My mom ordered a steak dinner.
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,The steak was puny and dry...and the baked potato tasted dirty and old.
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,She did enjoy the salad bar.
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,I didn't take advantage of it; it was too close to the entrance and therefore not appetizing to me.
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,My mom also stated that there were no locks on the bathroom doors.
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,She also witnessed an employee not washing their hands after using the restroom next to her.
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,"We didn't stay for dessert, and I didn't order a cocktail I had been eyeing."
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,"Based on our experience (as well as plenty of Facebook reviews stating the drinks totally sucked), we weren't missing out on anything there."
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,"After visiting this BurgerPalace, it was immediately clear to me why so many of them in the Northeast Ohio area shuttered...and it's mind boggling to me how this one is still operating!"
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,I have never wanted to un-eat a meal so badly in my life.
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,It was truly a God-given miracle that we didn't wind up with food poisoning!
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,"Not worth the money, avoid at all costs."
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,Go to the nearby Wendy's or Steak & Shake.
214,Td18Ed2-YyMdI0hDje2dwQ,1,You'll get way better quality food for a fraction of the cost.
215,oF602fC4mZTYA9EgbgWl0Q,1,VERY DISAPPOINTED!
215,oF602fC4mZTYA9EgbgWl0Q,1,Used to come here regularly.
215,oF602fC4mZTYA9EgbgWl0Q,1,Had been at least a year but I was craving a famous BurgerPalace salad bar tonight and came here for dinner with a couple friends.
215,oF602fC4mZTYA9EgbgWl0Q,1,The parking lot had so many potholes I really didn't even feel safe parking there.
215,oF602fC4mZTYA9EgbgWl0Q,1,Such a safety hazard!
215,oF602fC4mZTYA9EgbgWl0Q,1,Someone could trip and including the elderly.
215,oF602fC4mZTYA9EgbgWl0Q,1,"Walking in I saw just how disorganized and unattractive the salad bar was with food scattered all about, contaminating surfaces, and other bowls of food."
215,oF602fC4mZTYA9EgbgWl0Q,1,They were out of croutons (the best part of the salad bar).
215,oF602fC4mZTYA9EgbgWl0Q,1,Luckily the server brought me a separate plate of them but why didn't they just stock the bar?
215,oF602fC4mZTYA9EgbgWl0Q,1,No reason for the salad bar to look like this.
215,oF602fC4mZTYA9EgbgWl0Q,1,The sliders I got with the salad bar were bland and didn't taste very fresh.
215,oF602fC4mZTYA9EgbgWl0Q,1,The only good thing was the zucchini I got as my side which had always one of my favorite things about RT.
215,oF602fC4mZTYA9EgbgWl0Q,1,Server didn't know anything about the drink specials or what was considered a martini.
215,oF602fC4mZTYA9EgbgWl0Q,1,Didn't have broccoli salad or some of the other things I'm used to getting.
215,oF602fC4mZTYA9EgbgWl0Q,1,"Unfortunately, I don't see this location being open another 3 months and will most likely close like all the other locations if it doesn't change soon!"
216,PDAIxKiZ_bnbu2CnU1U_zg,5,EXCELLENT HOT.
216,PDAIxKiZ_bnbu2CnU1U_zg,5,Food.
216,PDAIxKiZ_bnbu2CnU1U_zg,5, Great value for quality.
216,PDAIxKiZ_bnbu2CnU1U_zg,5,Wonderful server!
216,PDAIxKiZ_bnbu2CnU1U_zg,5, The salad bar was well stocked although we did not participate.
216,PDAIxKiZ_bnbu2CnU1U_zg,5,It was offered however with our meal for extra cost.
216,PDAIxKiZ_bnbu2CnU1U_zg,5, All of us got BBQ.
216,PDAIxKiZ_bnbu2CnU1U_zg,5,Their signature hickory bourbon sauce is slightly spicy but sweet.
216,PDAIxKiZ_bnbu2CnU1U_zg,5,  We will stop again on our way to Ohio turnpike
217,hFEDDhyzTXRP2tsW1rJY_w,5,Went to RT for lunch today.
217,hFEDDhyzTXRP2tsW1rJY_w,5,Impressed that they were following all of the COVID protocols.
217,hFEDDhyzTXRP2tsW1rJY_w,5,Gas the 2 for 22 special.
217,hFEDDhyzTXRP2tsW1rJY_w,5,Food served was delicious!
217,hFEDDhyzTXRP2tsW1rJY_w,5,Had the honey glazed chicken and my wife had the tenders.
217,hFEDDhyzTXRP2tsW1rJY_w,5,Will be going back!
218,HW9OS_H3AmPNj668uUYF-g,2,"While food received was good, had grub hub delivery."
218,HW9OS_H3AmPNj668uUYF-g,2," Paid premium price, order incomplete."
218,HW9OS_H3AmPNj668uUYF-g,2, Customer Service passed did not resolve issue.
218,HW9OS_H3AmPNj668uUYF-g,2, NEVER use Grub Hub!
219,-xYFMYT-3Ua73ALVER13qQ,4,"I've been here a million times, usually 4-5 stars but today was 3-star for sure."
219,-xYFMYT-3Ua73ALVER13qQ,4, While it's not this locations responsibility - how do they not have an app?!
219,-xYFMYT-3Ua73ALVER13qQ,4,"And when I tried ordering online, it wouldn't go through so I had to call the order in."
219,-xYFMYT-3Ua73ALVER13qQ,4," Then, they messed the order up - I ordered chicken Parmesan with broccoli cheese soup ...got chicken Alfredo with broccoli."
219,-xYFMYT-3Ua73ALVER13qQ,4, Everything was good but not what I ordered & it was near closing so I couldn't do much about it.
219,-xYFMYT-3Ua73ALVER13qQ,4," Food is always great, service is solid & the salad bar is my favorite thing about BurgerPalace"
219,-xYFMYT-3Ua73ALVER13qQ,4, I look forward to more 5-star experiences in the future to make up for today's.

221,Ar8S4KIL3n14EFsJzdtazA,3,We were excited to see a salad bar again!
221,Ar8S4KIL3n14EFsJzdtazA,3,We come for the salad!
221,Ar8S4KIL3n14EFsJzdtazA,3,This location however wasnt the best.
221,Ar8S4KIL3n14EFsJzdtazA,3,Our waiter was stressed and we could see they were understaffed...part of why I didnt give a lower score.
221,Ar8S4KIL3n14EFsJzdtazA,3,I understand businesses are struggling for help.
221,Ar8S4KIL3n14EFsJzdtazA,3,We were patient waiting for service.
221,Ar8S4KIL3n14EFsJzdtazA,3,We all got salad bar and some an entree.
221,Ar8S4KIL3n14EFsJzdtazA,3,The salad bar was out of a lot of items and it did not look attended to.
221,Ar8S4KIL3n14EFsJzdtazA,3,"Even in understanding, it was frustrating as that was my meal."
221,Ar8S4KIL3n14EFsJzdtazA,3,The entress came out 27 mins later.
221,Ar8S4KIL3n14EFsJzdtazA,3,The tater tops were awesome and food was hot.
221,Ar8S4KIL3n14EFsJzdtazA,3,They were running a special 2 for $24 and add endless salad and drink on for $5.That
221,Ar8S4KIL3n14EFsJzdtazA,3,seemed a good deal!
221,Ar8S4KIL3n14EFsJzdtazA,3,We didnt see our waiter again till end of meal.
221,Ar8S4KIL3n14EFsJzdtazA,3,We received the bill and found we had been charged $5.99 for salad and $2.89 for drink that was to be $5 as printed on special menu.
221,Ar8S4KIL3n14EFsJzdtazA,3,We advised the waiter who stated we were wrong as he tried to tell us it was only on another special.
221,Ar8S4KIL3n14EFsJzdtazA,3,"Frustrated we pointed it out to him, and to his surprise we were right."
221,Ar8S4KIL3n14EFsJzdtazA,3,So we paid the bill and ledt only 15% for his tip.
221,Ar8S4KIL3n14EFsJzdtazA,3,Watch your tabs here!
222,QexiQXVzBaATA7ky_Ys7Ew,3,Server did a great job.
222,QexiQXVzBaATA7ky_Ys7Ew,3,Food was average and salad bar was less than average.
222,QexiQXVzBaATA7ky_Ys7Ew,3,Staff was very friendly.
223,H1cWMFRTfU46QEqJRSdVlw,1,Went there on Friday evening at 6pm.
223,H1cWMFRTfU46QEqJRSdVlw,1,They were not that busy.
223,H1cWMFRTfU46QEqJRSdVlw,1,We were seated rather quickly.
223,H1cWMFRTfU46QEqJRSdVlw,1,in about 10 min the waitress came over took our drink order and she asked us if we were ready to order and we did.
223,H1cWMFRTfU46QEqJRSdVlw,1,After 10 minutes we were still waiting for our drinks so I flagged the waitress down and asked for them.
223,H1cWMFRTfU46QEqJRSdVlw,1,I got the salad bar not impressed !
223,H1cWMFRTfU46QEqJRSdVlw,1,Husband ordered a bacon cheeseburger waited 50 minutes and had to flag her down again to ask for the check as we had to leave to get to our movie.
223,H1cWMFRTfU46QEqJRSdVlw,1,She said hold on then goes to kitchen and brings out his food out she says do you still want it and we said no because we can't take it into the movies!
223,H1cWMFRTfU46QEqJRSdVlw,1,So she says well you don't have to pay for salad bar or drinks.
223,H1cWMFRTfU46QEqJRSdVlw,1,Which we would have but
223,H1cWMFRTfU46QEqJRSdVlw,1,in a nut shell it was all ridiculous no reason that it should have taken so long!
223,H1cWMFRTfU46QEqJRSdVlw,1,Won't be going there again!
224,0w9ddA8z3FSikDcIxPRvAA,2,There were two hard clear plastic pieces of plastic mixed into my salad.
224,0w9ddA8z3FSikDcIxPRvAA,2, Disappointed.
225,sOi42X-Ba4OBh5DQEOaLgg,2,"This review is based only on the fact that they say that they are open until 10:00, yet when we got there at 9:13, the doors were locked and we could see employees looking at us."
225,sOi42X-Ba4OBh5DQEOaLgg,2," After a very long day of getting horses and ourselves ready and down to State Fair, we just wanted a quick, tasty meal, it was extremely frustrating to select a restaurant, get there and then be ignored :("
226,kJ87sXwpvo8TDFp65WJ5dg,2,I only go to this restaurant when other people want to.
226,kJ87sXwpvo8TDFp65WJ5dg,2, The main reason I never want to go is that is is sooo disgusting.
226,kJ87sXwpvo8TDFp65WJ5dg,2,"The floor is so nasty, it made my shoes stick."
226,kJ87sXwpvo8TDFp65WJ5dg,2, How can anyone that manages this restaurant not notice how dirty it is?
226,kJ87sXwpvo8TDFp65WJ5dg,2,"The windowsills are full of dead bugs, the blinds are splattered with old food and god knows what."
226,kJ87sXwpvo8TDFp65WJ5dg,2, And the floors.
226,kJ87sXwpvo8TDFp65WJ5dg,2, 
226,kJ87sXwpvo8TDFp65WJ5dg,2,Ugh.
226,kJ87sXwpvo8TDFp65WJ5dg,2, The floors look like something out of a dive bar in Guadalajara.
226,kJ87sXwpvo8TDFp65WJ5dg,2,"There have been a reviews about their floors from months ago, but obviously nothing was ever done."
226,kJ87sXwpvo8TDFp65WJ5dg,2," If the kitchen is even half as dirty, make sure your hepatitis shots are up to date!"
226,kJ87sXwpvo8TDFp65WJ5dg,2,That being said - the service is usually pretty decent and the drinks aren't half bad
227,sVmejjCHuPCN6rwzfmkMyg,1,Awful service.
227,sVmejjCHuPCN6rwzfmkMyg,1,Our entire order was missing the sides and drinks.
227,sVmejjCHuPCN6rwzfmkMyg,1,I called to talk to someone about fixing the issue and I got hung up on.
227,sVmejjCHuPCN6rwzfmkMyg,1,Twice.
227,sVmejjCHuPCN6rwzfmkMyg,1,"Then, when I called back again it took 5 minutes of ringing before they answered."
227,sVmejjCHuPCN6rwzfmkMyg,1,Then they proceeded to place me on hold for over 15 minutes.
227,sVmejjCHuPCN6rwzfmkMyg,1,I hung up.
227,sVmejjCHuPCN6rwzfmkMyg,1,"Never eat here, the staff is terrible."
228,KI9YkJmtqM7GO130t2pSzg,3,Food was good.
228,KI9YkJmtqM7GO130t2pSzg,3,"Had a couple of the mini me smokehouse burgers and a jalapeño burger, cooked well, the only thing that made this a 3 star rating was our waitress."
228,KI9YkJmtqM7GO130t2pSzg,3,She kept forgetting things in our order.
228,KI9YkJmtqM7GO130t2pSzg,3,She also kept complaining she had too many tables when there were about 6 tables for her.
229,gjhN11o5oXn2SORavk8krw,1,Friendly staff.
229,gjhN11o5oXn2SORavk8krw,1,This place is EXTREMELY DIRTY.
229,gjhN11o5oXn2SORavk8krw,1, I'm surprised they are still in operation.
230,tmH3oEvwewuCi3fvNohffA,1,"My Wife and I were here over a Month ago, and I had to write about this place.  After going to the Botanical Gardens, we decided to have Lunch here.  "
230,tmH3oEvwewuCi3fvNohffA,1,"We go in, and the Hostess seated us at a Booth which we wanted.  "
230,tmH3oEvwewuCi3fvNohffA,1,"As we're looking through the Menu, I noticed that the place had not been Vacuumed in who knows how long?!"
230,tmH3oEvwewuCi3fvNohffA,1," There was a smell there as well from the Carpet not being Vacuumed, and the Tables looked like they had not been Wiped Down in some time as well."
230,tmH3oEvwewuCi3fvNohffA,1,"We placed our Drink and Food order, and waited to close to an Hour for the Food to arrive!"
230,tmH3oEvwewuCi3fvNohffA,1," It wasn't crowded in there, so there should not have been an excuse for the Delay!"
230,tmH3oEvwewuCi3fvNohffA,1," After we got our Food, my Wife noticed that the 'Grilled Zucchini' was too Greasy to EAT!"
230,tmH3oEvwewuCi3fvNohffA,1," I tasted one, and it was!"
230,tmH3oEvwewuCi3fvNohffA,1," It was soaked in Grease for whatever reason, and it was AWFUL!"
230,tmH3oEvwewuCi3fvNohffA,1," I had the Chicken Tender Combo, and it wasn't great either."
230,tmH3oEvwewuCi3fvNohffA,1," Both of our orders tasted like the Chef and the Cooks in the Back did not care, and just sent out what they felt"
230,tmH3oEvwewuCi3fvNohffA,1,"like!Will not be returning here anytime soon, and I suggest you don't as well come here to eat for your Wallet and Stomach will thank you for not doing so!"
231,Jmt5osNy5xUsJfj_iZhcgA,1,This place has gone downhill fast.
231,Jmt5osNy5xUsJfj_iZhcgA,1,Ordered fried shrimp and it was foul looked like the kind that you buy in the frozen food section
232,TDGZQTOPJ6JkRN4uTAT42w,5,Came here today for lunch.
232,TDGZQTOPJ6JkRN4uTAT42w,5," My server was awesome, paid attention without hovering."
232,TDGZQTOPJ6JkRN4uTAT42w,5,"I got the backyard BBQ salad with a glass of wine, and carrot cake for dessert."
232,TDGZQTOPJ6JkRN4uTAT42w,5,All were delicious!
232,TDGZQTOPJ6JkRN4uTAT42w,5,"The salad bar was up and running, which I do love, but I'm not sure I'm ready for that yet."
233,_jcGCfvt2aSNEBeu6UF8Mw,1,Dear BurgerPalace no wonder you're going out of business.
233,_jcGCfvt2aSNEBeu6UF8Mw,1, We had 10 hungy people ready to eat and you turned us away?
233,_jcGCfvt2aSNEBeu6UF8Mw,1,Because you only have one server and one chef?
233,_jcGCfvt2aSNEBeu6UF8Mw,1,We would have gladly eaten the salad bar.
233,_jcGCfvt2aSNEBeu6UF8Mw,1, You still turned us away?
233,_jcGCfvt2aSNEBeu6UF8Mw,1,I guess you don't want our money or do you not like bikers?
234,YHJcRAYHmyE1l-ypDVVATg,1,"I have never been told that I can not be served and I need to leave a restaurant in my life, because I had a party of 5."
234,YHJcRAYHmyE1l-ypDVVATg,1,If you need to shut your doors and not be open I could unstained that.
234,YHJcRAYHmyE1l-ypDVVATg,1,BUT TO TOLD TO LEAVE AND TO BE RUDE ABOUT IT.
234,YHJcRAYHmyE1l-ypDVVATg,1,LETS SHUT THIS PLACE DOWN !!!!!!!
235,1nLv0FeD22mgm2osGP-g2g,3,No offense to BurgerPalace but my date and I went here sort of as a joke.
235,1nLv0FeD22mgm2osGP-g2g,3,We're on a tour of American chain restaurants and neither of us had been to BurgerPalace before.
235,1nLv0FeD22mgm2osGP-g2g,3,We were very pleasantly surprised!
235,1nLv0FeD22mgm2osGP-g2g,3,"I wasn't expecting the food to be that good, and keep in mind it is still a chain that probably gets a lot of frozen stuff from large food distributors, but it was a lovely meal overall!"
235,1nLv0FeD22mgm2osGP-g2g,3,"We started with the spinach artichoke dip, which was my least favorite item of the evening, kind of bland and obviously processed."
235,1nLv0FeD22mgm2osGP-g2g,3,We split a Smokehouse Burger topped with BBQ sauce and onion rings (pretty good) and this Asiago Bacon Chicken dish that was the real winner of the night.
235,1nLv0FeD22mgm2osGP-g2g,3,"Our server, Ashley, was friendly and quick to refill drinks."
235,1nLv0FeD22mgm2osGP-g2g,3,The molten lava cake could have used a little more lava but flavor wasn't bad.
235,1nLv0FeD22mgm2osGP-g2g,3,Skip the loaded tots though--the tots aren't crispy enough to carry the nacho cheese sauce and it just disintegrates into a lumpy mess.
236,ypfshyzTtme9Gjq9Zkadxg,1,"Husband and I went for meal, the waitress had no idea what the specials were, and we had to inform her of what should be offered as far as happy hour and the new Tex Mex menu."
236,ypfshyzTtme9Gjq9Zkadxg,1,She said no one ever orders from the Tex Mex menu so we skipped food and just got the salad bar.
236,ypfshyzTtme9Gjq9Zkadxg,1,"The place looked like it was still in COVID lock down, and people were turned away because of the wait (there was about 5 people in the place)."
236,ypfshyzTtme9Gjq9Zkadxg,1,"The carpet was dirty, the poor waitress was taking all orders and pouring drinks, and we think she was making the food."
236,ypfshyzTtme9Gjq9Zkadxg,1,"Good bye you sad, sad place."
237,MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1,"Alright, so the food was good."
237,MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1, The one star is for that.
237,MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1, It has been a long time since I had been to any BurgerPalace and at least I can say the food was up to par to what I remember.
237,MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1,"No stars for the service the evening I went with my cousins, last Saturday."
237,MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1, Did not know that they weren't seating parties of 8 (we had 2 4 people families).
237,MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1,"That's fine, but we came in TOGETHER so I would think that sitting them close to each would be the most appropriate thing to do."
237,MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1, 
237,MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1,Nope.
237,MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1, We were seated into the bar area and my cousins were in a booth.
237,MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1,And not close.
237,MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1, My kids and her kids couldn't play and see each other and the adults couldn't talk.
237,MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1, Couldn't even see each other.
237,MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1," I wondered why, oh emyeah, because the tables were not cleaned."
237,MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1," Hmmmm... and then our waiter....please, he was more interested in cleaning the bar then taking care of his table."
237,MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1," I understand that it was 9 p.m. at night but guess what, a customer is still a customer."
237,MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1,My cousin said their waiter was excellent and attentive.
237,MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1, Too bad we didn't have the same one.
237,MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1," When I went on to leave my review, I saw that this location got 2 and half stars."
237,MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1, I see why.
237,MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1," Again, food, Great."
237,MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1, Too bad the service didn't match the taste.
238,jMcRUW_MF8hM38p54QYmbQ,1,Food was ok bit not ok!
238,jMcRUW_MF8hM38p54QYmbQ,1,"I asked for a loaded baked potato and it was not loaded, had hardly no cheese, bacon, no butter no salt nor pepper."
238,jMcRUW_MF8hM38p54QYmbQ,1,Took forever to get our food.
238,jMcRUW_MF8hM38p54QYmbQ,1, I will not recommend this place to anyone.
238,jMcRUW_MF8hM38p54QYmbQ,1,Service was ok
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4,This BurgerPalace is located along Virginia Beach Blvd. at the corner of Constitution Dr.
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4, This is in the Town Center area of the city.

239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4, There is ample parking on site as well.
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4, The outside of the place looks typical for all BurgerPalace locations I have seen.
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4," My visit here was on January 1, 2021.Let"
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4,'s start with Covid-19 protocols

239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4, We were immediately greeted and seated when we came in.
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4, We went around the long way to our table to ensure social distancing.
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4," Once seated, Quinn came to the table to introduce herself, give us menus to look over, and asked what we wanted to drink."
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4," It had been a while since I had been to a BurgerPalace, so it took a little while to look through the menu."
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4,"After looking over the menu and the inserts, my mom and I decided to go with the 2 for $22 deal."
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4," For the starter, we went with the House Baked Soft Pretzels."
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4," For the entrees, we both went with the Classic Cheeseburger."
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4, We also added the Garden Salad bar as well.
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4,"Once ordered, we were able to go to the Garden Salad Bar."
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4, There are protocols in place here as well.
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4," It is self-service, but gloves and a new plate are required each time you go there (they are provided there for you)."
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4, The salad bar is actually pretty big with lots of different options.
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4, It turned out to be a really good beginning to lunch.
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4," A little bit after eating the salad items, the soft pretzels came out."
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4, The queso was a great dip to go along with it as well.
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4,"After about 10 minutes, the burgers came out to the table."
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4, The burgers were hot and the fries were as well.
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4, The burgers were cooked to order and juicy too.
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4, It was a really good meal overall for both of us.
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4, We were definitely full by the time we left.
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4,"Overall, this was a very good visit here."
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4, Service was on point and the food was great.
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4, I will definitely be coming back here in the future.
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4, They also have an e-mail rewards program.
239,GPRiGy42hnJIWzdEib7mEw,4," If you're in the Town Center area of the city, this place is still worth checking out for a meal."
240,EKT21Ok1YaFBCsMm2DwaFQ,1,Ordered Via UBER EATS - the delivery was prompt this review is strictly about the food service/meal.
240,EKT21Ok1YaFBCsMm2DwaFQ,1,The food was poorly packaged leading for sauce to leak all over the other containers and inside the bag.
240,EKT21Ok1YaFBCsMm2DwaFQ,1,"Side sauces were incorrect, missing drinks and parts of the order, lastly the food arrived barely warm."
240,EKT21Ok1YaFBCsMm2DwaFQ,1,Attempted to call the restaurant serval times - the automated answering machine redirected to the website and no availability to leave a voicemail.
241,nD436Br8-t35DQ1Z6UQE8w,1,Gave them another chance.
241,nD436Br8-t35DQ1Z6UQE8w,1,Waiters standing around and drinking alcohol on the job.
241,nD436Br8-t35DQ1Z6UQE8w,1,Ridiculous.
242,ZoEcGXIEg0hq9pp4xXqPBw,3,I ordered through grubhub the order arrived in 30 minutes fresh hot looking just like the picture I love their plating it's absolutely amazing sweet potato fries accompanied they were delicious and not too salty the  Crunchy chicken sandwich was still crunchy LA crunchy and cook 2 perfection season 2 perfectionhad bacon  Cheese.
242,ZoEcGXIEg0hq9pp4xXqPBw,3,nice soft toasted buttered roll.
242,ZoEcGXIEg0hq9pp4xXqPBw,3,I had a gift card that they seemed not to be able to accept anymore for some reason but I but I will order from them again when I don't feel like cooking
243,4BP-1cQjdhfQSEotSIUaYg,2,Terrible service despite restaurant being less than 50% full.
243,4BP-1cQjdhfQSEotSIUaYg,2,We were there 90 minutes for 2 kids meals and 2 adults.
243,4BP-1cQjdhfQSEotSIUaYg,2,Restaurant is at 50% capacity.
244,18Np3qMQVCETA5OC-Nfxhg,4,"Great dinner, fantastic service definitely the best we have had here in quite some time."
244,18Np3qMQVCETA5OC-Nfxhg,4,Our server Alexis was the best making recommendations and explaining everything.
244,18Np3qMQVCETA5OC-Nfxhg,4,She checked on us several times but not too many.
244,18Np3qMQVCETA5OC-Nfxhg,4,The full rack of baby back ribs were truly tender and did in fact fall off the bone.
244,18Np3qMQVCETA5OC-Nfxhg,4,The only item that was lacking was the upgraded Mac n cheese.
244,18Np3qMQVCETA5OC-Nfxhg,4,It had very little flavor.
244,18Np3qMQVCETA5OC-Nfxhg,4,Everything else was Great!
244,18Np3qMQVCETA5OC-Nfxhg,4,We will definitely be back and hope the improvements continue because we truly enjoy BurgerPalace menu.
245,ZK_sKIGautn4F9fiPdCmpw,1,This use to be a quality place to eat.
245,ZK_sKIGautn4F9fiPdCmpw,1, 
245,ZK_sKIGautn4F9fiPdCmpw,1,One of our favorites.
245,ZK_sKIGautn4F9fiPdCmpw,1, Today it was very wasn't.
245,ZK_sKIGautn4F9fiPdCmpw,1,Today it was extremely dirty.
245,ZK_sKIGautn4F9fiPdCmpw,1,The entry way stank and the glass was filthy.
245,ZK_sKIGautn4F9fiPdCmpw,1,"The lettuce on the bar was brown, half empty containers, unbelievably watery ranch dressing, and the glass cover was filthy."
245,ZK_sKIGautn4F9fiPdCmpw,1,Food in the floor.
245,ZK_sKIGautn4F9fiPdCmpw,1,Spatters of food on the side of unused tables.
245,ZK_sKIGautn4F9fiPdCmpw,1,Not to mention our waitress brought us our waters and we never saw her again.
245,ZK_sKIGautn4F9fiPdCmpw,1, I got up to get my own extra napkins and had to request the hostess (very sweet but young) to find our wayward waitress to give us our check.
245,ZK_sKIGautn4F9fiPdCmpw,1, Never again.
246,xTK189lKVWzHOfLzAUqeQQ,3,"Ok so hubby and I arrived and was sat quickly, waiter was good at first, until more people started arriving, seem like she was the only waiter although other waiters had come in."
246,xTK189lKVWzHOfLzAUqeQQ,3,"Had to remind for condiments I asked for, and also asked for extra napkins which never came, the waiter came back to our table clearly noticeable was our empty glasses, instead of asking if we need refills she asked if we needed to go boxes, I was literally chewing some food at the time, then the AC started blazing, clearly it was turned up."
246,xTK189lKVWzHOfLzAUqeQQ,3,We did get refills.
246,xTK189lKVWzHOfLzAUqeQQ,3,"I will say the salad bar is always on point the times I've visited any BurgerPalace they do pride themselves on that, so for that I will give 2 stars."
246,xTK189lKVWzHOfLzAUqeQQ,3,"Ok I will give 3 stars because they good about the Covid, however we probably won't be visiting any more of these establishments in the future."
247,SrCunsmh6EHZsc8fK7RGHw,5,"I don't expect much from chain restaurants which is why I have to say ""excellent job"" to this location."
247,SrCunsmh6EHZsc8fK7RGHw,5, We had a pleasant server and our food was literally some of the best on our whole vacation.
247,SrCunsmh6EHZsc8fK7RGHw,5, How unexpected was that???
247,SrCunsmh6EHZsc8fK7RGHw,5, We had a great meal at a very reasonable price and we left happy.
247,SrCunsmh6EHZsc8fK7RGHw,5, 
247,SrCunsmh6EHZsc8fK7RGHw,5,Thanks to the chef here for the great food and the staff for a job
247,SrCunsmh6EHZsc8fK7RGHw,5,well done!The
247,SrCunsmh6EHZsc8fK7RGHw,5,shrimp and sausage pasta dish was excellent by the way!
248,d0mnJRk4yI3Umo7JnNuZYw,5,Can't beat the bogo coupons they send.
248,d0mnJRk4yI3Umo7JnNuZYw,5,Burgers always good.
248,d0mnJRk4yI3Umo7JnNuZYw,5,We also like the ribs.
248,d0mnJRk4yI3Umo7JnNuZYw,5,Chicken Mac and cheese was surprisingly good too
249,VRMTxm9ppcn2FnDRkiViAQ,1,"The worst place to eat ever: looks dirty, ultra long wait to be served, the fries were very salted and tasted old oil."
249,VRMTxm9ppcn2FnDRkiViAQ,1,The waiter was incompetent.
249,VRMTxm9ppcn2FnDRkiViAQ,1,Avoid this place.
250,0kntC1sPj3qUeG8HozJ2MA,1,No response after emailing customer relations and providing information they requested.
251,ZY6eQLZvWIieMcTuYURYKg,4,"Don't sleep on BurgerPalace They have amazing ribs, salmon and chicken dinners!!"
251,ZY6eQLZvWIieMcTuYURYKg,4,"If you are craving a gray salad bar, they're the place for that too!"
251,ZY6eQLZvWIieMcTuYURYKg,4,BurgerPalace has amazing coupons and daily deals; and we're still trying to figure out how they stay in business when they give food away at crazy prices!
251,ZY6eQLZvWIieMcTuYURYKg,4,"Check it out, you won't be disappointed."
251,ZY6eQLZvWIieMcTuYURYKg,4,I gave them 4 stars because they closed the stores that were closed nearby!
252,PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1,Went there for lunch today and we both ordered the Garden Bar (we have always loved it).
252,PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1,It was below sub par.
252,PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1," Most, if not all, of the food on the bar was OLD."
252,PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1,"Brown lettuce, dried up cucumbers, dry pasta salad, rubbery spinach and broccoli, squash salad was dry on top from sitting out so long."
252,PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1,"I tried to eat some of each thing and it all kept getting worse, so I asked to see the manager."
252,PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1," He was polite, and removed the $11.99 x2 for the salad bars off our bill."
252,PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1," The waitress came over with our revised bill and said ""I looked at the salad bar and everything looked fine to me."""
252,PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1,"When I started telling her everything I listed above she rudely interrupted me and said ""wait...I'm leaving""."
252,PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1,And walked away.
252,PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1, If she didn't want to hear what I had actually experienced from the salad bar then why did she think it was ok to voice her inexperienced opinion?
252,PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1, She didn't eat any of it.
252,PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1, She had no idea how bad it is/was.
252,PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1, 
252,PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1,So I will not be returning because 1) they served old food and 2) rude wait staff named Autumn.
252,PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1,If I could I would give zero stars.
253,F0YSLv7NiUuNP5pCoOaQ5Q,5,My daughter and I stopped by on a Friday night for a meal.
253,F0YSLv7NiUuNP5pCoOaQ5Q,5, The host was kind enough to put us in a socially distanced area.
253,F0YSLv7NiUuNP5pCoOaQ5Q,5, NeNe was the waitress that helped us.
253,F0YSLv7NiUuNP5pCoOaQ5Q,5," She was friendly, funny and made sure we had refills and everything we needed."
253,F0YSLv7NiUuNP5pCoOaQ5Q,5," The dry rub ribs were delicious, especially with sauce on the side."
253,F0YSLv7NiUuNP5pCoOaQ5Q,5, My daughter had the salad bar and loves the salad bar pasta.
253,F0YSLv7NiUuNP5pCoOaQ5Q,5, Special thanks to NeNe for excellent service.
254,84sU1gBYoROhVwjBphrVZw,3,Would be great if the delivery and takeout menus were matched and easy to order from.
254,84sU1gBYoROhVwjBphrVZw,3,"I tried for over an hour to order a hamburger, fries and a dessert to be delivered."
254,84sU1gBYoROhVwjBphrVZw,3,I finally gave up and ordered a shrimp and pasta dish just to get it done!
254,84sU1gBYoROhVwjBphrVZw,3,"It seams that you cannot get a simple order for delivery, but you can order family size meals."
254,84sU1gBYoROhVwjBphrVZw,3,I almost did.
254,84sU1gBYoROhVwjBphrVZw,3,This is frustrating!!
255,5I23H7Fpx4liJwVMysl9NA,1,"Ordered delivery today from ""Libby's BBQ"" and come to find out it is really BurgerPalace Way to SCAM your guests!!!"
255,5I23H7Fpx4liJwVMysl9NA,1,Never would have ordered it if I knew that in advance.
255,5I23H7Fpx4liJwVMysl9NA,1,The food and portions were average at best and the prices were EXTREMELY high compared to the other BBQ places in the area that serve better food.
255,5I23H7Fpx4liJwVMysl9NA,1,I will never be back and by the way a 90% health food grade SUCKS given the fact you get 2 extra point for mgrs. being serve safe certified.
255,5I23H7Fpx4liJwVMysl9NA,1,Assuming your mgrs. are certified???
255,5I23H7Fpx4liJwVMysl9NA,1,"your real score is an 88% a ""B""!!"
255,5I23H7Fpx4liJwVMysl9NA,1,Another SCAM!!!
256,IhTGFQBUBSNUocgkOzLEMA,1,This sign says staff wear a mask but the people in the back cooking the food do not have masks on and some of the staff are walking around with the mask half or entirely off their face.
256,IhTGFQBUBSNUocgkOzLEMA,1,The manager has it hanging half off one ear so it's obviously not enforced.
256,IhTGFQBUBSNUocgkOzLEMA,1,If management doesn't take it seriously the why would the staff.
257,hnDmMQ9Ov46VrpYwgebR4w,1,Worst place in the area to order food.
257,hnDmMQ9Ov46VrpYwgebR4w,1,"I ordered on line and they didn't have an item that was listed, so instead of calling me to change the sides they gave me something I don't eat."
257,hnDmMQ9Ov46VrpYwgebR4w,1,Trying to eat after surgery abs have to deal with this.
257,hnDmMQ9Ov46VrpYwgebR4w,1, 
257,hnDmMQ9Ov46VrpYwgebR4w,1,Called the manager Ryan and he said it's nothing he can do I need to contact ubereats even though my order say sweet potato and they gave me a baked potato ‍ poor customer Service.
257,hnDmMQ9Ov46VrpYwgebR4w,1,He was rude and said if you want your money back you deal with them.
257,hnDmMQ9Ov46VrpYwgebR4w,1,I didn't ask about no money.
257,hnDmMQ9Ov46VrpYwgebR4w,1,I would like to eat
258,jP-492Ni8xz05T9VXDo14Q,3,"The 20-year-old hostess, the very first person you see when you walked through the door,  was not wearing a mask at all."
258,jP-492Ni8xz05T9VXDo14Q,3,And she said something like she wished everything were back to normal.
258,jP-492Ni8xz05T9VXDo14Q,3,The manager was aware of her not wearing a mask but said and did nothing.
258,jP-492Ni8xz05T9VXDo14Q,3,"If the resto industry -- and all industries for that matter-- wants to keep functioning, then they should enforce strict rules for both employees and customers to protect people who care enough about their health and others."
258,jP-492Ni8xz05T9VXDo14Q,3,You would think they have sense enough to know this so as not to alienate their customers.
258,jP-492Ni8xz05T9VXDo14Q,3,I think the government should step in and make this part  of every resto's health inspection.
258,jP-492Ni8xz05T9VXDo14Q,3,P.S.
258,jP-492Ni8xz05T9VXDo14Q,3,Too bad their grilled chicken and chicken & broccoli were not so bad.
258,jP-492Ni8xz05T9VXDo14Q,3,And our waitress was fantastic.
258,jP-492Ni8xz05T9VXDo14Q,3,But eating in a resto isn't just about food-- it's also about experience.
259,bMsYPrHvJgY4UsLaiT53Og,5,This place never disappoints!
259,bMsYPrHvJgY4UsLaiT53Og,5,Best and friendliest service around.
259,bMsYPrHvJgY4UsLaiT53Og,5,The salad bar is always stocked and food is always delicious!
259,bMsYPrHvJgY4UsLaiT53Og,5,If you want a pleasant dining experience in Garner don't pass on BurgerPalace
260,MX5-xt6pDhgNBOtw7Xxi0Q,4,Have not been there in a while but enjoyed the atmosphere.
260,MX5-xt6pDhgNBOtw7Xxi0Q,4,Ordered the grilled chicken sandwich as I didn't want a heavy lunch.
260,MX5-xt6pDhgNBOtw7Xxi0Q,4,It was alright and I had tater tots with it.
260,MX5-xt6pDhgNBOtw7Xxi0Q,4,"You could choose a few sides, free of charge, to replace fries."
260,MX5-xt6pDhgNBOtw7Xxi0Q,4,There were other sides for an up charge fee.
260,MX5-xt6pDhgNBOtw7Xxi0Q,4,"The plus side was, after I ordered it, the waitress told me it was the special for day."
260,MX5-xt6pDhgNBOtw7Xxi0Q,4,It was only 5.99.
260,MX5-xt6pDhgNBOtw7Xxi0Q,4,Been a while since I had a special for the day anywhere.
260,MX5-xt6pDhgNBOtw7Xxi0Q,4,Meet my frat brother for lunch since I was in his city.
260,MX5-xt6pDhgNBOtw7Xxi0Q,4,He ordered the salmon salad and it looked good.
260,MX5-xt6pDhgNBOtw7Xxi0Q,4,He really enjoyed it.
260,MX5-xt6pDhgNBOtw7Xxi0Q,4,Yes I would suggest the place.
261,dWquNKsDrzARHK2jyDagyg,5,Hubby got the philly steak and cheese hoagie and said it was wonderful.
261,dWquNKsDrzARHK2jyDagyg,5,I got my salad bar as usual.
261,dWquNKsDrzARHK2jyDagyg,5,"Everything was fresh, clean and plentiful."
261,dWquNKsDrzARHK2jyDagyg,5, Gordan W. was our server.
261,dWquNKsDrzARHK2jyDagyg,5,He was awesome.
261,dWquNKsDrzARHK2jyDagyg,5,"Very accommodating, polite and totally on point in every way."
261,dWquNKsDrzARHK2jyDagyg,5,We'll be back!!
262,cCBErpg1CDuPK2D9Cux2YQ,2,Everything was merely ok.
262,cCBErpg1CDuPK2D9Cux2YQ,2,I've had better Stouffer's meals.
262,cCBErpg1CDuPK2D9Cux2YQ,2,"‍ The menu looked fabulous, however the reality was not so fab."
262,cCBErpg1CDuPK2D9Cux2YQ,2,Are they actually cooking in the kitchen or reheating pre-prepared meals?
263,KKq3n3ZwMEqX94PFaO3kWQ,1,Covid is nothing but a scapegoat for awful service.
263,KKq3n3ZwMEqX94PFaO3kWQ,1,This place could give a crap less if I came in and ate or not.
263,KKq3n3ZwMEqX94PFaO3kWQ,1,Stood at door for 5 minutes before being acknowledged.
263,KKq3n3ZwMEqX94PFaO3kWQ,1,Place was empty.
263,KKq3n3ZwMEqX94PFaO3kWQ,1,Got seated and no one acknowledges me there either so I left.
264,jR-zmtELwpXtB6Vbc9Exsw,1,Walked in after traveling all day and was seated by the hostess.
264,jR-zmtELwpXtB6Vbc9Exsw,1,"After waiting 15 minutes for a server, we left."
264,jR-zmtELwpXtB6Vbc9Exsw,1,"Bartender was to busy flirting with a girl at the bar, other servers walked by us multiple times like we're not even there."
265,5-Y4MjFcWlm6ppxjEELciA,1,I have to say I strongly suggest skipping this restaurant.
265,5-Y4MjFcWlm6ppxjEELciA,1,"My wine came in a glass full of lipstick stains from a prior patron, my order took forever and I was incorrectly charged for the wrong, more expensive, chardonnay."
265,5-Y4MjFcWlm6ppxjEELciA,1,The salmon on the salad was decent but I guess I  expected more than iceberg lettuce.
265,5-Y4MjFcWlm6ppxjEELciA,1,My friend's meal was barely edible but she'll be posting her own review.
266,NpAs_RZpvGyWbLIdnusW7w,1,Let me say I understand the pandemic has caused a shortage of servers.
266,NpAs_RZpvGyWbLIdnusW7w,1, The manager customer service was worse than the  new server.
266,NpAs_RZpvGyWbLIdnusW7w,1, We waited an hour for our food which were quick pick options.
266,NpAs_RZpvGyWbLIdnusW7w,1,They got the  order wrong then the portion of the side  items was ridiculous.
266,NpAs_RZpvGyWbLIdnusW7w,1,They will not get my money ever again.
267,egkzTirKcj1wJZtDu_Orzg,1,"Never offered napkins l, only asked about another beer until I was finished and ready to leave."
267,egkzTirKcj1wJZtDu_Orzg,1,If the person at the bar would stay off FaceTime I might come back.
267,egkzTirKcj1wJZtDu_Orzg,1,"Food was good 1 star for that,  customer service sucked."
268,H6YdxOcrmquIkZS_3ep3VQ,1,The place needs renovation and thorough washing.
268,H6YdxOcrmquIkZS_3ep3VQ,1,"We ordered grilled salmon and it was literally cold/frozen  inside, so we had to wait for another grilled salmon."
268,H6YdxOcrmquIkZS_3ep3VQ,1,Shouldn't they check temperature of the inside of meat or fish if it's cooked?..  Shrimp and scampi pasta was very plain.
268,H6YdxOcrmquIkZS_3ep3VQ,1,The only thing was good was smoked burger with fries.
268,H6YdxOcrmquIkZS_3ep3VQ,1,Soft drinks took too long to refill.
268,H6YdxOcrmquIkZS_3ep3VQ,1,We left disappointed with the experience.
269,0d1sEnL3ACHKEXdtAbSbpA,2,Food is mediocre .
269,0d1sEnL3ACHKEXdtAbSbpA,2,I called ahead and confirmed with the bartender that they had kids eat free on tuesdays after 5pm.
269,0d1sEnL3ACHKEXdtAbSbpA,2,We had three adult meals and three kids meals .
269,0d1sEnL3ACHKEXdtAbSbpA,2,The manager refused to give us the kids eat free discount even though someone on the staff confirmed they were still offering the special .
270,w0zbAxQ8yTPXLPaIF1itEA,1,The food was burned and missing chicken from the dish.
270,w0zbAxQ8yTPXLPaIF1itEA,1,I
271,uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.
271,uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,"On Mother's Day, I felt that I wanted to at least order my mother and I a steak since we couldn't do what we really want due to the Covid 19 outbreak."
271,uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,"Now, before people say give them a break because of this, just know the similar restaurants in the same area are just known to be less than a pleasurable experience."
271,uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,I ordered online and my mother actually was picking it up to bring on the way to see me so that we may eat together.
271,uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,She called from up there to tell em the curb side was a no go because after 20 minutes of waiting no one came out so she went in.
271,uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,The manager was the one who dealt with my mother in saying that the order wasn't ready and didn't know when it would be.
271,uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,"She also said the ticket number didn't matter because they were so overwhelmed and ""everyone ordered steak""."
271,uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,Not a good look.
271,uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,My mother handed her the phone because I called to see if everything was ok.
271,uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,The manager basically told me the same thing.
271,uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,"If I hadn't paid ahead, of course I would have cancelled."
271,uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,I had my mother leave because I didn't want her having to do all that on Mother's Day.
271,uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,My husband went back up there and brought the order back almost two hours after it was supposed to be done.
271,uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,( I gave them an hour because of Covid and it being Mothers Day).
271,uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,The steak was thrown together.
271,uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,There was no difference in the well and medium well done steaks and both were missing the salad.
271,uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,We did however get the baked potato but that was a no go because they decided to put bacon bits on it when that's not how we ordered it because guess what... you guessed it.
271,uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,I don't eat pork .
271,uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,This was ridiculous.
271,uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,I hope any other companies who decide to open back up during the pandemic is ready.
271,uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,"This manager told me that they are open , but not fully staffed."
271,uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,"They aren't fully open not ready to serve inside, curb side and to go like they say."
271,uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,Plus they had a line out of the door trying to figure out what happened to their online order and curbside orders.
271,uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,"They may as well have opened their dining room up to full capacity because the way this was set up, there was literally no room for social distancing if that was their goal."
271,uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,Do better Camp Creek BurgerPalace !!!
272,WmdhlaNYV6R59mQCi41d2w,3,"Nice dining area, long wait just order food, short staffed, 3-cheese brisket sandwich okay"
272,WmdhlaNYV6R59mQCi41d2w,3,.
272,WmdhlaNYV6R59mQCi41d2w,3,The cheese and Texas toast are good but the bacon-like brisket is too chewy and fatty filled.
272,WmdhlaNYV6R59mQCi41d2w,3,The fries are crispy good.
272,WmdhlaNYV6R59mQCi41d2w,3,The brisket tacodilla has the same issues as the 3-cheese brisket.
272,WmdhlaNYV6R59mQCi41d2w,3,Now the salad bar is a different story.
272,WmdhlaNYV6R59mQCi41d2w,3,That's still good & highly recommended.
273,EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,The food was just ok to me.
273,EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,It did come out very hot so I could tell they just cooked it.
273,EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,I think the reason I gave it a 3 star was cause the drinks were very weak.
273,EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,So I was a little disappointed.
273,EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,I was hoping for a stronger taste but was disappointed.
273,EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,The staff was very nIce and accommodating.
273,EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,The waiter was also on point.
273,EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,He kept checking on us to see if we needed anything.
273,EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,"Made sure our food was cooked like we wanted, and just a nice guy overall."
273,EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,The salad bar needed to be refreshed.
273,EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,I wasn't liking the choices.
273,EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,It looked like it had been picked over.
273,EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,So even though we got the salad bar I wanted it to have fuller.
273,EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,I will say once I started heading towards the door to leave a worker was at the salad bar replenishing the food but I was already leaving.
273,EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,I will come back because all in all it was a positive experience.
274,3zsv7rqwdSVaFdCY13y0tQ,1,Jessica has to be the absolute worst waiter I have ever encountered .
274,3zsv7rqwdSVaFdCY13y0tQ,1,We went on a whim here and did we regret ever bit of it.
274,3zsv7rqwdSVaFdCY13y0tQ,1,If I could give negative zero stars I would happily do so.
274,3zsv7rqwdSVaFdCY13y0tQ,1,Non attentive staff makes the mediocre at best food 10x worse.
274,3zsv7rqwdSVaFdCY13y0tQ,1,This place needs to shut down.
274,3zsv7rqwdSVaFdCY13y0tQ,1,"And Jessica needs to be fired for her lazy, non attentive, rude self."
275,45A18KgZHku4uN2zk3_Jlg,1,10/10 dont recommend... hardly anyone in the restaurant and they have to hold the door for 45 mins... even a party of 2 had to leave.
275,45A18KgZHku4uN2zk3_Jlg,1, lazy/rude management.
276,48s3ofH6VMIoWJzYmIcQMQ,4,"We ate here on Super Bowl night had appetizer, meal & drinks all things we had were good."
276,48s3ofH6VMIoWJzYmIcQMQ,4,We had no problem with service.
277,ELAwTYPKkbpQv64kUDSQcw,2,"Service is very slow, kitchen seems to constantly be backed up."
277,ELAwTYPKkbpQv64kUDSQcw,2,Prepare to wait quite a while.
278,BElYTFA8Rsxc4qQsRIM4qQ,2,"15 minute wait to be seated when the restaurant was at less than 50% capacity, they are understaffed."
278,BElYTFA8Rsxc4qQsRIM4qQ,2," The salad bar was not well maintained, the food and dressings were all mixed."
278,BElYTFA8Rsxc4qQsRIM4qQ,2,"The salad plates were dirty, had to go through 5 before finding a clean one."
278,BElYTFA8Rsxc4qQsRIM4qQ,2, My drink glass was dirty as well.
278,BElYTFA8Rsxc4qQsRIM4qQ,2,"The food was not prepared well, some parts over cooked and some under cooked"
278,BElYTFA8Rsxc4qQsRIM4qQ,2,.
278,BElYTFA8Rsxc4qQsRIM4qQ,2, The runner took my wife's meal to another table then back to the front again before brining it to our table as if it were something to show off to everyone.
278,BElYTFA8Rsxc4qQsRIM4qQ,2, I remember when BurgerPalace was a nice place.
278,BElYTFA8Rsxc4qQsRIM4qQ,2, We were disappointed by everything except out waiter.
279,ZRqT1p2NYeD0dfK2HEJhGA,1,We have been there three times each time the salad bar has been amazing as for the rest of the food not so great me and my wife both ordered steaks and our 10-year-old daughter ordered the salmon
279,ZRqT1p2NYeD0dfK2HEJhGA,1,the food was horrible I believe roadkill would've tasted better should've went to Arby's across the street this is the third time in A six-month period the service was great the food was horrible will not be a fourth time eat at your own risk go to Burger King or McDonald's you will feel better afterwards
280,nvlAgo7gE77Hh0LpRbo1Cg,1,This place has gone downhill in the last 6 months.
280,nvlAgo7gE77Hh0LpRbo1Cg,1,My last 2 visits I had poor service.
280,nvlAgo7gE77Hh0LpRbo1Cg,1,There were only a few people in the restaurant and the service was extremely slow.
280,nvlAgo7gE77Hh0LpRbo1Cg,1,I had a cockroach crawl across the wall of our booth and saw a 2nd above the door!
280,nvlAgo7gE77Hh0LpRbo1Cg,1,I will NOT be back!
281,02bq1Hl1po5SBULseiBHlA,2,Bad service.
281,02bq1Hl1po5SBULseiBHlA,2, I understand you're busy but some friendliness isn't very difficult.
281,02bq1Hl1po5SBULseiBHlA,2, If it's hard for you to be polite or smile don't get a service job.
282,qpXK1vh4DIeJjvT4URUGQw,2,Hadn't been to this location in well over a year.
282,qpXK1vh4DIeJjvT4URUGQw,2,My husband and I were very disappointed.
282,qpXK1vh4DIeJjvT4URUGQw,2,We were very surprised that the endless salad bar was an additional $5.99.
282,qpXK1vh4DIeJjvT4URUGQw,2,In the past you could always get it as a side with your entree.
282,qpXK1vh4DIeJjvT4URUGQw,2,However with inflation we were understanding that restaurants have to raise prices.
282,qpXK1vh4DIeJjvT4URUGQw,2,But the salad bar was not well stocked and missing several items.
282,qpXK1vh4DIeJjvT4URUGQw,2,If we have to pay $5.99 you would think that it would be well maintained.
282,qpXK1vh4DIeJjvT4URUGQw,2,"We did not have a problem with our service, but overall the restaurant was dirty."
282,qpXK1vh4DIeJjvT4URUGQw,2,We will not be returning.
282,qpXK1vh4DIeJjvT4URUGQw,2,What a shame!
282,qpXK1vh4DIeJjvT4URUGQw,2,It had always been one of our favorites.
283,DUEv4I1tjNWT2j8YFsdYcg,3,"Hi Service was excellent this visit we ordered the Ribs and salad bar and once again the ribs were very dry and side portions small we didn't bother saying anything because we don't like to send food back, also the salad bar could use more items or at least kept full so your not getting end of the bowl stuff with other food always being mixed in gross."
283,DUEv4I1tjNWT2j8YFsdYcg,3, we went at5:30 on a Thursday wasn't that busy so you would salad bar would be kept up we will be back just was little disappointed for the $55 we spent
284,UH9rvwG1m2csOW9UKBN1Og,2,We had had some issues before trying to order the emailed specials for the day using the app.
284,UH9rvwG1m2csOW9UKBN1Og,2,Essentially they won't let you order what they emailed you ...you have to call it in.
284,UH9rvwG1m2csOW9UKBN1Og,2,Ok.
284,UH9rvwG1m2csOW9UKBN1Og,2,I call it in and I made the dinners the same just to be easier.
284,UH9rvwG1m2csOW9UKBN1Og,2,The special was 10.99 for 6 oz steak dinner and 11.99 for 6 oz ribeye.
284,UH9rvwG1m2csOW9UKBN1Og,2,(we are seniors so 6oz is ok).
284,UH9rvwG1m2csOW9UKBN1Og,2,He shows up to pick up the order and instead of 2x 6 oz steaks we have 2 full size and full priced steaks.
284,UH9rvwG1m2csOW9UKBN1Og,2,He gives up and just takes it because waiting another 30-45 minutes was worse.
284,UH9rvwG1m2csOW9UKBN1Og,2,He brings the food home and it's also not cooked correctly.
284,UH9rvwG1m2csOW9UKBN1Og,2,So the 25.00 special was 50.00 and not at all what we wanted.
284,UH9rvwG1m2csOW9UKBN1Og,2,I have finally given up on Ruby!!
285,OMS9hX8ZECC0jw1kvxXg1A,1,"How this ""restaurant"" is still open is beyond me!There"
285,OMS9hX8ZECC0jw1kvxXg1A,1,must've been one cook.
285,OMS9hX8ZECC0jw1kvxXg1A,1,One rookie cook.
285,OMS9hX8ZECC0jw1kvxXg1A,1,"Despite slow and poor service, the meals were terrible--there was 15 of us, EVERY dish was overcooked!"
285,OMS9hX8ZECC0jw1kvxXg1A,1,"I ordered medium-rare and was served a dry old well-done burger; fries weren't bad, though."
285,OMS9hX8ZECC0jw1kvxXg1A,1,"Same with all the other burgers at our table (and the salmon, steak, and chicken).Our app with guac consisted of maybe 20 chips."
285,OMS9hX8ZECC0jw1kvxXg1A,1,We ended up eating the remainder with our spoons.
285,OMS9hX8ZECC0jw1kvxXg1A,1,We did ask one of the servers for more but she must've forgot because she never did return.
285,OMS9hX8ZECC0jw1kvxXg1A,1,"If I could give this rating a zero stars, I would!"
285,OMS9hX8ZECC0jw1kvxXg1A,1,I don't see this place sticking around much longer.
286,zJodjaUHGzV29pvpZ36vEA,2,After an outrageously long road trip me and my best friends family we were so starving we had been waiting all day for a great BurgerPalace burger but when we got there the disappointment was just waiting for us
286,zJodjaUHGzV29pvpZ36vEA,2,The waiter took very poor care of us she only checked in on us one time I find that completely unacceptable our food was messed up and half of us didn't even get the right order it was horrible the burger was soggy and the fries were not done well I am completely and utterly disappointed this is not OK I will not be going back to Alabama to try a BurgerPalace burger ever again unacceptable!!!!!the only good thing there was my root beer!!!!
287,QXkJVi4QFJSJ7iFJdIliqw,1,Disgusting.
287,QXkJVi4QFJSJ7iFJdIliqw,1,About 5 of us ordered a burger medium - well done and they were PINK.
287,QXkJVi4QFJSJ7iFJdIliqw,1,"All of us felt sick as well as the one who got the Mac and cheese, that one puked."
287,QXkJVi4QFJSJ7iFJdIliqw,1,Took 2 hours for no reason and we were served last after people who got there after us.
287,QXkJVi4QFJSJ7iFJdIliqw,1,We had to walk up to pay as it took well over 10 minutes to grab the card reader because we were so over it.
287,QXkJVi4QFJSJ7iFJdIliqw,1,I hate ruby fucking tuesdays
288,oK0l7jxokhcEzYore9Rg9Q,1,My fiancé and I came here for lunch since we were in the area.
288,oK0l7jxokhcEzYore9Rg9Q,1,"I of course expected the garden bar to be open, which I had read online was reopened with COVID safety precautions in place, but it wasn't open."
288,oK0l7jxokhcEzYore9Rg9Q,1,"When I tried to order a shrimp fajita with no peppers, the server gave me a hard time about it."
288,oK0l7jxokhcEzYore9Rg9Q,1,I didn't realize requesting to NOT put something on a plate was so difficult.
289,CRTKAOdUqr5gvikQldGaCw,1,"We had a reservation for 8 people and we walk in and the lady who was very rude asked for our name and we had told her, then she said it was for 2."
289,CRTKAOdUqr5gvikQldGaCw,1,Terrible service.
290,aL1T6ehjf5RZkJsF8uiBfQ,1,This service sucks.
290,aL1T6ehjf5RZkJsF8uiBfQ,1,Never eating here again.
290,aL1T6ehjf5RZkJsF8uiBfQ,1,I would rather go to governors.
290,aL1T6ehjf5RZkJsF8uiBfQ,1,At least their servers are friendly and check in on you.
290,aL1T6ehjf5RZkJsF8uiBfQ,1,This is ridiculous.
290,aL1T6ehjf5RZkJsF8uiBfQ,1,Sat for an hour while the server walked  circles around us.
290,aL1T6ehjf5RZkJsF8uiBfQ,1,She never once asked how the good was outdated when the food would be out.
290,aL1T6ehjf5RZkJsF8uiBfQ,1,She obviously does like her job or know what she is doing
290,aL1T6ehjf5RZkJsF8uiBfQ,1,.
290,aL1T6ehjf5RZkJsF8uiBfQ,1,Only talked to us when we placed our order.
290,aL1T6ehjf5RZkJsF8uiBfQ,1,That's it.
290,aL1T6ehjf5RZkJsF8uiBfQ,1,Ridiculous!!
291,WwGQtiTLNbS3zlQPh7q9XQ,5,One of my fat places the freshest salad bar.
291,WwGQtiTLNbS3zlQPh7q9XQ,5, Always clean and quick service!
291,WwGQtiTLNbS3zlQPh7q9XQ,5, Very customer friendly
292,FX3wHLDSmjSdct3wXU2t-A,2,A shadow of its former self.
292,FX3wHLDSmjSdct3wXU2t-A,2,You will find a scant all-you-can-eat salad bar for 12 plus dollars.
292,FX3wHLDSmjSdct3wXU2t-A,2,"You will not find pasta, chips, salsa, soup, or much of anything."
292,FX3wHLDSmjSdct3wXU2t-A,2,The coconut shrimp was fair but expensive and a fairly small portion.
292,FX3wHLDSmjSdct3wXU2t-A,2,The ice tea was very good.
292,FX3wHLDSmjSdct3wXU2t-A,2,I would avoid this restaurant for the foreseeable future.
293,prMdrZHMVJLJork-NjZSXw,1,We were on the road heading to Arizona.
293,prMdrZHMVJLJork-NjZSXw,1,We stopped at the BurgerPalace for lunch.
293,prMdrZHMVJLJork-NjZSXw,1,We ordered our meal to go to eat it in the RV.
293,prMdrZHMVJLJork-NjZSXw,1,The Backyard BBQ salad was nothing but burnt chicken (no BBQ sauce) and lettuce.
293,prMdrZHMVJLJork-NjZSXw,1,"It was missing all of the other ingredients, including the dressing."
293,prMdrZHMVJLJork-NjZSXw,1,Returned it for a new one.
293,prMdrZHMVJLJork-NjZSXw,1,This time it had all the ingredients but very little lettuce.
293,prMdrZHMVJLJork-NjZSXw,1,"The BBQ sauce was drenched on the salad, and it had the same burnt chicken as I took a bite out of the one I returned."
293,prMdrZHMVJLJork-NjZSXw,1,There was the piece I ate.
293,prMdrZHMVJLJork-NjZSXw,1,The restaurant was empty so there was no reason for this type of service.
293,prMdrZHMVJLJork-NjZSXw,1,Definitely not worth the $14.00.
294,SyDcfeC_X9UNG7OW_fNs_Q,2,My son and I got the smothered bbq sirloin.
294,SyDcfeC_X9UNG7OW_fNs_Q,2,The sirloin was tough as leather!
294,SyDcfeC_X9UNG7OW_fNs_Q,2,"And, they didn't put bacon on it as advertised."
294,SyDcfeC_X9UNG7OW_fNs_Q,2,Service was good.
294,SyDcfeC_X9UNG7OW_fNs_Q,2,It's pretty bad when the broccoli was the best thing on the plate!
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,Oh gee --- I tried to really think about how I could rate this experience better than 1..
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,  The server was a 4 as she was trying her best.... but if this is how this place is managed...  will never go to another BurgerPalace again.
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,Went to BurgerPalace across the street from our hotel.
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1, 
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,Tried to go to a Mexican restaurant which is normal for us when out of town ---  but it was Cinco De Mayo so ---- all forget going to a Mexican restaurant unless you want to wait for an hour and ...  well...  never mind.
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,The parking lot was nearly empty so thought a good choice....
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,WRONG!!!
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1, Only two servers and one bartender.
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1, Most of the tables were empty because no one was working.
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1," Hostess was sweet, kind, and very nice!!"
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1, 
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,Told us it would be about a 25 minute wait so ...  we did.
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1, Once we were seated we decided to share a few Mexican appetizers since Mexican food is one of our favorites and the salad bar looked less than appealing --- which was the original plan.
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,"  Ordered two appetizers -- one was the nachos and didn't want the bbq sauce (yes, on chicken nachos) so asked if we could get salsa."
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1, The server was very accommodating...
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1, We also ordered the bean and chicken quesadilla.
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1, Food came up in about 20 min which was okay based on the fact that very few people were working.
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1, The food was warm at best ---  the quesadilla was about a 6 and was pretty good --- light on fillings and seemed like a small portion --- but the best food
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,we had!The
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,"nachos --- Well --- really, really not good!"
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,!
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1, The chicken was not cool but seemed to come  out of the refrigerator..  The cheese was lumped like nacho cheese but lumpy and cool...
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,"  The salsa --- well, it was the warmest food on the plate but it wasn't salsa -- IT WAS"
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,MARINARA!!!Our
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,server came by and I kindly let her know that the kitchen probably accidentally gave us marinara instead of salsa...
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1," and she said ---- ""They said they are out of salsa and this was the closest thing they had..""  WHAT????    A side a marinara with our nachos and they thought we wouldn't notice it wasn't salsa???????????????????$30 later and we should have gone to Taco Bell for a much BETTER DINNER as this was the horrible!!!  "
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,Tipped our server for doing a great job as we were thankful she came to work.
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,Ruby Tuesdays --- WOW --- Never so disappointed.
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1, Before COVID and the world we used to live would have never put up with this...
295,Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,  Thanks for coming to work ---  Good luck staying open with this type of food!
296,A7PId4fv3g-wUR-Oscfqmg,4,They took care of us on Thanksgiving.
296,A7PId4fv3g-wUR-Oscfqmg,4,Ten of us on deck.
296,A7PId4fv3g-wUR-Oscfqmg,4,The customer service was decent but they attitude was Great
297,N1hyjcHiL-kBm3Lrr1s-7g,5,Tori was so great.
297,N1hyjcHiL-kBm3Lrr1s-7g,5,She was the best server.
297,N1hyjcHiL-kBm3Lrr1s-7g,5,Very sweet and easy going with my young kids and they can be a lot and talk quite a bit:)  
297,N1hyjcHiL-kBm3Lrr1s-7g,5,She was great at getting refills and everything came out perfect.
297,N1hyjcHiL-kBm3Lrr1s-7g,5,Food was great.
297,N1hyjcHiL-kBm3Lrr1s-7g,5,We will be back!
298,kPsPLWp4fC__sLxAU36ZOg,2,"Drove to Litchfield to enjoy BurgerPalace it was a Sunday, they didn't have the garden bar open and sat for 10 min finally asked someone who was waiting our table"
299,WUNj8DsX9D0aPsrN5kuOwA,5,So we are doing the historic Route66 and needed a good dinner during the pandemic.
299,WUNj8DsX9D0aPsrN5kuOwA,5,Just happened to see this BurgerPalace and thought they might be open.
299,WUNj8DsX9D0aPsrN5kuOwA,5,"Not until Friday but the manager, Sam, was absolutely wonderful."
299,WUNj8DsX9D0aPsrN5kuOwA,5,He brought a table outside so we could enjoy a great dinner.
299,WUNj8DsX9D0aPsrN5kuOwA,5,"Our lovely waitress, Jan, did a great job."
299,WUNj8DsX9D0aPsrN5kuOwA,5,Very personal.
299,WUNj8DsX9D0aPsrN5kuOwA,5,It was so nice to sit and enjoy a tasty meal during this crazy time.
299,WUNj8DsX9D0aPsrN5kuOwA,5,"Hubby had a 6 oz. steak that was cooked to perfection and I had chicken in a cream, mushroom sauce that was to die for."
299,WUNj8DsX9D0aPsrN5kuOwA,5,If we ever get back to area will definitely stop again.
300,8Ay9gl6sSfy7RMTASW_a6Q,1,1 because I cant give a 0.
300,8Ay9gl6sSfy7RMTASW_a6Q,1,Gross!!!
300,8Ay9gl6sSfy7RMTASW_a6Q,1,We ordered online and the whole order was messed up.
300,8Ay9gl6sSfy7RMTASW_a6Q,1,The mashed potatoes that we didn't even order were gray in color and inedible.
300,8Ay9gl6sSfy7RMTASW_a6Q,1,Probably sat there for days.
300,8Ay9gl6sSfy7RMTASW_a6Q,1,The ribs were disgusting and tasted like they've been sitting there for a while as well.
300,8Ay9gl6sSfy7RMTASW_a6Q,1,"The lettuce in the salad was almost slimy textured, sour and brown."
300,8Ay9gl6sSfy7RMTASW_a6Q,1,Very disappointed.
300,8Ay9gl6sSfy7RMTASW_a6Q,1,Don't recommend.
300,8Ay9gl6sSfy7RMTASW_a6Q,1,We got nothing we ordered and what they did give us was disgusting and inedible.
300,8Ay9gl6sSfy7RMTASW_a6Q,1,Waste of money.
301,SzP6LmRdN1tJB3eloI65yw,2,Not a fan but my guy totally loves their full rack of ribs and salad bar.
301,SzP6LmRdN1tJB3eloI65yw,2,"I ordered the ribeye, which can always be a little iffy ordering steak from these type of franchises."
301,SzP6LmRdN1tJB3eloI65yw,2,It wasn't bad!
301,SzP6LmRdN1tJB3eloI65yw,2,Not full of fat or grisly.
301,SzP6LmRdN1tJB3eloI65yw,2,Flavor just okay.
301,SzP6LmRdN1tJB3eloI65yw,2,Baked potato and broccoli standard for this kind of place.
301,SzP6LmRdN1tJB3eloI65yw,2,The shrimp were a huge disappointment!
301,SzP6LmRdN1tJB3eloI65yw,2,"They were breaded, flavorless and cold inside."
301,SzP6LmRdN1tJB3eloI65yw,2,Tasted like they breaded some shrimp that were like shrimp cocktail.
301,SzP6LmRdN1tJB3eloI65yw,2,Don't order the flavored lemonade unless you want diabetes.
301,SzP6LmRdN1tJB3eloI65yw,2,"This is two star rating, however it's an improvement from a visit in June."
302,c6g6OcmMPgzBREXZx-HSeg,4,My daughter & I went to this location for lunch on MLK day.
302,c6g6OcmMPgzBREXZx-HSeg,4,"We were very impressed by the amount of spacing the severs sat each table, all employees wore their masks & inside was clean as well."
302,c6g6OcmMPgzBREXZx-HSeg,4,My daughter noticed for the salad bar you had to get wore disposable gloves which was great to see.
302,c6g6OcmMPgzBREXZx-HSeg,4,  My daughter order the smoked house burger well done w/ the bbq sauce on the side w/ fries & I ordered order the honey chicken sandwich w/ fries (honey mustard sauce & onion rings on the side) & spinach artichoke dip with chips.
302,c6g6OcmMPgzBREXZx-HSeg,4,Everything was order to perfection & all our food was delicious.
302,c6g6OcmMPgzBREXZx-HSeg,4,We felt very safe dining inside during lunch time since it was minimum people at this time.
302,c6g6OcmMPgzBREXZx-HSeg,4,  A tip; sign up for their emails to get a free appetizer w/ $10 purchase of email & also you will receive a free meal for your birthday (long expiration date which is a plus) & also you can dine in or carry out for either promotion which is amazing.
302,c6g6OcmMPgzBREXZx-HSeg,4,"Sorry, we did not take pictures of our food this time."
303,HnpPeYDlimmxPaGfzBSbgQ,2,Disappointing $85 dinner for a family of four.
303,HnpPeYDlimmxPaGfzBSbgQ,2,  Out of several menu items we wanted (veggie pizza on special).
303,HnpPeYDlimmxPaGfzBSbgQ,2," We were overcharged for beer -- charged as craft beer but it was domestic beer, this was corrected."
303,HnpPeYDlimmxPaGfzBSbgQ,2,  Son complained about burger taste so we tried it and it was not very good.
303,HnpPeYDlimmxPaGfzBSbgQ,2," Service was good, only positive experience from our visit."
304,K9F-UDqIyGt1Ouj7rbDfcQ,1,we ordered delivery service.
304,K9F-UDqIyGt1Ouj7rbDfcQ,1,this does not matter to the service but I think the restaurants think they can omit and shave off how much food to give the people.
304,K9F-UDqIyGt1Ouj7rbDfcQ,1,"""Southwest Fried Chicken"
304,K9F-UDqIyGt1Ouj7rbDfcQ,1,"Bowl$10.29Diced chicken tenders served over cilantro lime rice, corn, shredded cheese, pico de gallo, lettuce, and fresh avocado."
304,K9F-UDqIyGt1Ouj7rbDfcQ,1,Topped with sour cream and tortilla strips.
304,K9F-UDqIyGt1Ouj7rbDfcQ,1,"""here is what I got."
304,K9F-UDqIyGt1Ouj7rbDfcQ,1,a hand full of food which consisted of mostly lettuce and rice with chicken.
304,K9F-UDqIyGt1Ouj7rbDfcQ,1,the chicken was present.
304,K9F-UDqIyGt1Ouj7rbDfcQ,1,which it better be.
304,K9F-UDqIyGt1Ouj7rbDfcQ,1,some cheese.
304,K9F-UDqIyGt1Ouj7rbDfcQ,1,"no pico, corn or avocado that I could witness.  little sour cream and the tortilla strips were stale and inedible.the bowl"
304,K9F-UDqIyGt1Ouj7rbDfcQ,1,of soup
304,K9F-UDqIyGt1Ouj7rbDfcQ,1,for $5
304,K9F-UDqIyGt1Ouj7rbDfcQ,1,was no more than a cup of
304,K9F-UDqIyGt1Ouj7rbDfcQ,1,soup.sorry
304,K9F-UDqIyGt1Ouj7rbDfcQ,1,"ruby, no more from me"
305,c9p30U6-MsCm2AZarwziww,5,"I love this place, I always get a meal and then the salad bar."
305,c9p30U6-MsCm2AZarwziww,5,"I normally take my meal home, because of how great the salad bar is."
305,c9p30U6-MsCm2AZarwziww,5,I love a shrimp pasta dish they offer.
305,c9p30U6-MsCm2AZarwziww,5,"The pasta is great, and the seasoning on the shrimp is even better."
305,c9p30U6-MsCm2AZarwziww,5,"But I love their salad bar, with pasta choices, and so much more."
305,c9p30U6-MsCm2AZarwziww,5,I also love the rye croutons.
306,tSIq9aWlj0aMSOUWwCZbVA,5,I loveeee this place.
306,tSIq9aWlj0aMSOUWwCZbVA,5,"This is the only BurgerPalace I've ever been to, but I am very impressed!"
306,tSIq9aWlj0aMSOUWwCZbVA,5,"Friendly service every time, hot food every time, and no wait time!"
306,tSIq9aWlj0aMSOUWwCZbVA,5,I don't understand why this place isn't packed EVERY DAY!
306,tSIq9aWlj0aMSOUWwCZbVA,5,"Keep it up, I love it here!"
307,YgL3uZNs7vgJBECFdK6Trw,4,Only.reason it's a rating of 4 is because when my man and myself went there for lunch.
307,YgL3uZNs7vgJBECFdK6Trw,4,We ordered the ribeye steaks.
307,YgL3uZNs7vgJBECFdK6Trw,4,But it would have been nice for the server to inform us that they didn't have anything to put on the steaks other than Worcestershire sauce when we were ordering because we may have wanted to change our order.
307,YgL3uZNs7vgJBECFdK6Trw,4,But we weren't informed until after our steaks were brought out.
308,-tNZ3dQNhQRhdL5KAE0apg,1,"The ""Boneless Wings"" were absolutely horrible."
308,-tNZ3dQNhQRhdL5KAE0apg,1," All breading, very little children and so much vinegar you actually gag.  1/3 of America is diabetic or Prediabetic and they have NOTHING but salad they can eat."
309,NpsWODc82pt74zCIg6Knmw,3,So here's my opinion and it is just that.
309,NpsWODc82pt74zCIg6Knmw,3, Ruby's is always a hit or miss.
309,NpsWODc82pt74zCIg6Knmw,3, I never go in expecting great food or service.
309,NpsWODc82pt74zCIg6Knmw,3,I am never surprised when things aren't tasty and I have never been surprised with amazing food either.
309,NpsWODc82pt74zCIg6Knmw,3,Generally the staff is friendly.
309,NpsWODc82pt74zCIg6Knmw,3, It is a decent place to take a family
310,eeXso6erbVbDA1JEOOS5uA,5,Except for the staffing shortage - which seems to increasingly be impacting the industry - I liked my two times there this year.
310,eeXso6erbVbDA1JEOOS5uA,5,"As long as they keep that salad bar fresh, tho use croutons addictive, and the apps hot - were happy (also good experience at the one near BWI last week)"
311,l57DFQwHSB2I8F_Q3YgxrQ,2,I am beginning to think the franchise has a problem.
311,l57DFQwHSB2I8F_Q3YgxrQ,2,"The BurgerPalace I used to visit in Rosslyn (since closed down) was pretty terrible in regards to service, availability, and choices."
311,l57DFQwHSB2I8F_Q3YgxrQ,2,"It was a few years since visiting any of their establishments, and was hoping it would be a nice experience, especially so close to where I live."
311,l57DFQwHSB2I8F_Q3YgxrQ,2,"I'll just say that it fell below my expectations, and even then, they weren't that high."
311,l57DFQwHSB2I8F_Q3YgxrQ,2,"It's understaffed (at least when I visited) which leads to an overworked waiter/waitress, which then leads to mistakes."
311,l57DFQwHSB2I8F_Q3YgxrQ,2,"My wife's order was incorrect, my burger came out thirty minutes ahead of her meal, and it took an additional 10 minutes to be given the ketchup I had asked for."
311,l57DFQwHSB2I8F_Q3YgxrQ,2,"I really dislike giving bad reviews, I try to look at the best in everything, but without saying a word to each other during the lunch due the awkward nature of the environment, the first thing my wife and I said to each other (as if it were rehearsed) is, ""We're not coming here again."
311,l57DFQwHSB2I8F_Q3YgxrQ,2,"""That quote should tell you enough about our experience."
312,dINmk0-eRjGodK8J3KNukA,4,Celebrated a birthday here for a large party and it was solid.
312,dINmk0-eRjGodK8J3KNukA,4,I ordered the hickory bourbon half ribs with shrimp and my sides were tater tots and grilled zucchini.
312,dINmk0-eRjGodK8J3KNukA,4,The baby back ribs were delicious.
312,dINmk0-eRjGodK8J3KNukA,4,"Tender, flavorful, and fall off the bone."
312,dINmk0-eRjGodK8J3KNukA,4,They didn't get enough sauce which is why I asked for more on the side.
312,dINmk0-eRjGodK8J3KNukA,4,The other items were fine.
312,dINmk0-eRjGodK8J3KNukA,4,Shrimps were kinda small so I would've just ordered a full rack instead of half rack of ribs.
312,dINmk0-eRjGodK8J3KNukA,4,Our waitress also did a great job of making sure we were all taken care of.
312,dINmk0-eRjGodK8J3KNukA,4,Solid dinner spot.
313,j_SCimK6XrNuCbRubd8Gvg,1,Came in today with my family and from the very start i knew things would be bad.
313,j_SCimK6XrNuCbRubd8Gvg,1,I can't give the waiters name because he never told us he just had on a buffalo bills face mask.
313,j_SCimK6XrNuCbRubd8Gvg,1,Our problems started with the drinks that he kept messing up because he refused to write our order down.
313,j_SCimK6XrNuCbRubd8Gvg,1,As we moved on to ordering our food he continued to get the order wrong as we placed it.
313,j_SCimK6XrNuCbRubd8Gvg,1,I looked at my wife and told her be ready because our food is coming out wrong.
313,j_SCimK6XrNuCbRubd8Gvg,1,Sure enough 1 hour later our food comes out and my burger is beyond under cooked.
313,j_SCimK6XrNuCbRubd8Gvg,1,My wife's steak is so tuff that she couldn't even chew it.
313,j_SCimK6XrNuCbRubd8Gvg,1,Our daughter's burger was overcooked she didnt even touch it.
313,j_SCimK6XrNuCbRubd8Gvg,1,All the waiter said to us was we can order something new ?!
313,j_SCimK6XrNuCbRubd8Gvg,1,Why do you can bring that order out wrong as well.
313,j_SCimK6XrNuCbRubd8Gvg,1,My advice is that management have waiters write people's order down and not try to remember them the odject is to work smarter not harder.
314,s35lKjKgQ7PRzb-GZQVxlw,3,"[Review is pre-pandemic]Came here twice, once with a large group of 8 people and other time with just another co-worker."
314,s35lKjKgQ7PRzb-GZQVxlw,3,Service is slow even when there are not a lot of people.
314,s35lKjKgQ7PRzb-GZQVxlw,3,Food is so-so.
314,s35lKjKgQ7PRzb-GZQVxlw,3,This is a chain after all.
314,s35lKjKgQ7PRzb-GZQVxlw,3,"There was one time that I order honey glazed pork, I believe, and I thought it was actually pretty good."
314,s35lKjKgQ7PRzb-GZQVxlw,3,But the food quality is definitely hit or miss.
314,s35lKjKgQ7PRzb-GZQVxlw,3,Forget about a waitress that checks on you.
314,s35lKjKgQ7PRzb-GZQVxlw,3,Always had to walk around a bit to flag one down to get the check.
314,s35lKjKgQ7PRzb-GZQVxlw,3,Wouldn't advise coming here unless you have a larger group and look like you can afford to tip a lot.
315,WSTwa3pwRfI9ottLT7OsQw,5,Salad bar is amazing.
315,WSTwa3pwRfI9ottLT7OsQw,5,Fresh and so appetizing  . They kept it coming.
315,WSTwa3pwRfI9ottLT7OsQw,5,My weekly routine.
316,MCmKG_zvHPRD9V_f9d8dfw,1,Chose this place because Jaspers was packed.
316,MCmKG_zvHPRD9V_f9d8dfw,1,Thought it be ok even though upon wak in there were hardly any customers.
316,MCmKG_zvHPRD9V_f9d8dfw,1,"Our server wasn't bad, she wasn't great but she did an ok job."
316,MCmKG_zvHPRD9V_f9d8dfw,1,That aside I had to send my food back and she got a little attitude about that.
316,MCmKG_zvHPRD9V_f9d8dfw,1,Then ordered food to take home (blackened talapia) and got home and discover the fish was still raw in the middle.
316,MCmKG_zvHPRD9V_f9d8dfw,1,I will never dine here at this location again
317,RUeA2KEvS1Yd2_WM8XlHFQ,1,Just visited this location and it is absolutely disgusting the food had no taste and the waiter smelled like weed.
317,RUeA2KEvS1Yd2_WM8XlHFQ,1,Won't be visiting back anytime soon.
318,5_PfMaNETrIq3ImrPYEYdA,1,Four of us arrived and told the person at the door that we had a bigger party coming but wasnt sure of the number.
318,5_PfMaNETrIq3ImrPYEYdA,1,"Guy to seat us got ak attitude and said that he ""needed a number"" before he could seat us."
318,5_PfMaNETrIq3ImrPYEYdA,1,Everyone in the party arrived but was told that all 12 of us would have to be on one check and couldn't split them.
318,5_PfMaNETrIq3ImrPYEYdA,1,"When pressed, someone else said we could do one alcohol check and the other food."
318,5_PfMaNETrIq3ImrPYEYdA,1,"Seeing that this would be difficult for a party of 12 and the Atticus received, we left and went to Outbaco which was next door and got better service, told we could be seated all at one table and would be able to split the checks."
318,5_PfMaNETrIq3ImrPYEYdA,1,"if I lived here, I'd never come back to this restaurant based on tonight's experience and may not ever go to a different BurgerPalace"
319,tTAtmjw7BrBXHb4Mul_4yw,1,"-10, horrible, will never return."
319,tTAtmjw7BrBXHb4Mul_4yw,1,I placed a to-go order.
319,tTAtmjw7BrBXHb4Mul_4yw,1," When I entered the restaurant, no one greeted me."
319,tTAtmjw7BrBXHb4Mul_4yw,1," I walked to the back where I guess ""the manager"" was having a discussion with an employee."
319,tTAtmjw7BrBXHb4Mul_4yw,1,"I asked an older female server for my order and the ""manager"" without saying anything to me, said ""that's the order I told you about, its on the shelf""."
319,tTAtmjw7BrBXHb4Mul_4yw,1,"She gave me a blank stare and said she would get my salad bar bowl and drinks, ""there's your food"".  "
319,tTAtmjw7BrBXHb4Mul_4yw,1,"OK, I would be fine with that, but then a young man runs from behind the bar and proceeds to loudly curse out a co-worker in the back (I'm with my teenage child) ""Why the f$#@ did you make the Long-Island ice tea??"
319,tTAtmjw7BrBXHb4Mul_4yw,1,"I'm the bartender""!!"
319,tTAtmjw7BrBXHb4Mul_4yw,1," I was flabbergasted, the ""manager"" did nor said anything."
319,tTAtmjw7BrBXHb4Mul_4yw,1, I quickly made my salad and left.
319,tTAtmjw7BrBXHb4Mul_4yw,1," At home, my wing order, a drink, a side dish & condiments were missing."
319,tTAtmjw7BrBXHb4Mul_4yw,1,Shame
320,8OV52A7CVLPGmvsl3Oqe9w,1,Just about every staff member was on their cellphone.
320,8OV52A7CVLPGmvsl3Oqe9w,1, The tables were not busted.
320,8OV52A7CVLPGmvsl3Oqe9w,1, Wait staff was not service oriented.
320,8OV52A7CVLPGmvsl3Oqe9w,1, Lackadaisical.
320,8OV52A7CVLPGmvsl3Oqe9w,1, Seemed to have a kids corner in the back.
320,8OV52A7CVLPGmvsl3Oqe9w,1, Never go there again'

321,8g0U6rL2EQnEkh_xq_osvg,1,"The food was over cooked and or as dry as the establishment and after waiting 45 minutes for food in an empty restaurant, they forgot two orders and when we expressed our concerns to the manager kiki, she literally stood there silently and I had to ask her to respond ."

324,KtszzIfWJelT8sQW3WOLiQ,1,"Just cause that's how they do it yonder in Sioux Falls, does not make it cool here."
324,KtszzIfWJelT8sQW3WOLiQ,1,It makes you (corporate) or ( franchisee) look like a person or manager that can't run a business.
324,KtszzIfWJelT8sQW3WOLiQ,1,Time to step up and pay a decent wage.
324,KtszzIfWJelT8sQW3WOLiQ,1,"Your dining room will be full, you suppliers will give better deals for volume, and you'll be profitable."
324,KtszzIfWJelT8sQW3WOLiQ,1,Right now you look like a highly subsidized farmer or group of farmers looking for a tax write off.
324,KtszzIfWJelT8sQW3WOLiQ,1,You can't be successful without the American taxpayer apparently.
324,KtszzIfWJelT8sQW3WOLiQ,1,"In either endeavor, ya fucking loser."

325,VGKsZfGAoKht_ZfZcgokng,5,Prices are(were) in line with other comparable restaurants.
325,VGKsZfGAoKht_ZfZcgokng,5,A very nice bar and we thought the restaurant was very clean.

327,QD_N9mqYQSepffrrrNRgfw,5,Went to BurgerPalace after getting no one to wait on us at Whiskey Creek (due to waiter being to busy drinking and talking with other staff) .
327,QD_N9mqYQSepffrrrNRgfw,5, BurgerPalace was very busy but walked in the door and was immediately greeted and got to our seat and order taken and drinks delivered with in 5 minutes.

328,uIll5COivZaSLuaWWaCODg,1,Ordered the food to go.
328,uIll5COivZaSLuaWWaCODg,1,It was cold and disgusting.
328,uIll5COivZaSLuaWWaCODg,1,Everything was sticky and the hamburger was like 3/4 of a patty.
328,uIll5COivZaSLuaWWaCODg,1,Chips were stale and small amount of dip for the price.
328,uIll5COivZaSLuaWWaCODg,1,shrimp were overcooked.
328,uIll5COivZaSLuaWWaCODg,1,Will not order from again.
329,PysUqQnPZBjUdmZhKZujGg,1,Extremely disappointed.
329,PysUqQnPZBjUdmZhKZujGg,1, First started with no salad bar due to lack of employees.
329,PysUqQnPZBjUdmZhKZujGg,1, Yet there are multiple employees standing around with nothing to do.
329,PysUqQnPZBjUdmZhKZujGg,1," Second fault was bit into my chicken corn chowder and cold as can be, thus your soup is not fresh."
329,PysUqQnPZBjUdmZhKZujGg,1, Simply microwaved from fridge.
329,PysUqQnPZBjUdmZhKZujGg,1, Third strike to one star rating ordered salmon and 1/3 of it was raw.
329,PysUqQnPZBjUdmZhKZujGg,1, Urge you to go elsewhere.
329,PysUqQnPZBjUdmZhKZujGg,1, No offer by server to comp anything knowing the failure to deliver quality food.
330,_5tkLBQl_D4sJuSMmAejFg,1,The restaurant was absolutely filthy.
330,_5tkLBQl_D4sJuSMmAejFg,1,The hostess quickly put on a mask when she saw me wearing mine.
330,_5tkLBQl_D4sJuSMmAejFg,1,She literally seated us at a dirty table.
330,_5tkLBQl_D4sJuSMmAejFg,1,I asked for a different one.
330,_5tkLBQl_D4sJuSMmAejFg,1,They would only seat in the dirty section.
330,_5tkLBQl_D4sJuSMmAejFg,1,There was a clean section but they would not seat anyone there because it had been cleaned for the night.
330,_5tkLBQl_D4sJuSMmAejFg,1,"The floor was covered in food, it did not smell clean at all and the food was sub par."
330,_5tkLBQl_D4sJuSMmAejFg,1,I would have left but my husband was hungry and no other late night options.
330,_5tkLBQl_D4sJuSMmAejFg,1,The waitress was very sweet and helpful so she got a nice tip.
330,_5tkLBQl_D4sJuSMmAejFg,1,It wasn't her fault.
330,_5tkLBQl_D4sJuSMmAejFg,1,We will not eat there again.
331,m3jzariHFSWcECxjuPa_Aw,2,I wanted to give this 3 stars.
331,m3jzariHFSWcECxjuPa_Aw,2,I thought the waitress was both friendly and attentive.
331,m3jzariHFSWcECxjuPa_Aw,2,Even with the tail end of COVID still lingering the salad bar was up and running which is a plus.
331,m3jzariHFSWcECxjuPa_Aw,2,I know it's my fault for ordering ribs from here.
331,m3jzariHFSWcECxjuPa_Aw,2,I know that RT is not an award winning bbq establishment.
331,m3jzariHFSWcECxjuPa_Aw,2,It was late and I wanted to keep rolling so this is where I stopped.
331,m3jzariHFSWcECxjuPa_Aw,2,The ribs arrived with minimal sauce.
331,m3jzariHFSWcECxjuPa_Aw,2,I had to ask for more.
331,m3jzariHFSWcECxjuPa_Aw,2,"But even though they were fall-off-the-bone, they were DRY."
331,m3jzariHFSWcECxjuPa_Aw,2,Probably would have been happier had I just ordered the salad bar.
332,6Tuyrt2oHaU0n7NCbaQaZQ,4,Best salad bar in town.
332,6Tuyrt2oHaU0n7NCbaQaZQ,4,"Service varies - sometimes lacking, sometimes great...dishes are pretty good but love that salad bar!!!"
333,4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,Was looking forward to a good hot meal after a long day of travel.
333,4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,Sat at the bar which was my first mistake.
333,4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,Basically a hang out area for all the employees who do not have customers help.
333,4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,It was very loud with all of their work chatter.
333,4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,The drink was good.
333,4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,"I ordered the 12oz ribeye, asked for it medium well."
333,4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,When it arrived it looked a bit funky.
333,4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,I questioned if it was beef.
333,4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,It looked like a pork chop.
333,4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,When I cut into it it was very bloody.
333,4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,"Now the blood is in my potatoes and corn, couldn't stomach that."
333,4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,"Asked to have it cooked longer, twice."
333,4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,"When it was returned to me it was not replated, served on a small salad plate."
333,4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,Needless to say it wasn't good.
333,4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,And I'm still pretty sure it wasn't beef.
333,4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,Just not good food or experience.
333,4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,Stick with the salad bar.
334,aBcnhUftabS-5ptRw0LC7g,5,Had a new chef training and our server Alison was so attentive.
334,aBcnhUftabS-5ptRw0LC7g,5,she caught on right away that something was wrong and returned with a new burger that was cooked just right.
334,aBcnhUftabS-5ptRw0LC7g,5,she was at our table frequently and the service was GREAT.
334,aBcnhUftabS-5ptRw0LC7g,5,WONDERFUL SERVER.
335,W_2IAY9chhUGPgd8X7rrRA,2,Waited 30 minutes for burgers burnt beyond recognition.
335,W_2IAY9chhUGPgd8X7rrRA,2,This was my last time at BurgerPalace
336,Yxxgf_bT76Bi_Vuf4iZUpA,1,1 star is generous.
336,Yxxgf_bT76Bi_Vuf4iZUpA,1,Worst restaurant experience I have ever had.
336,Yxxgf_bT76Bi_Vuf4iZUpA,1,"Salad bar food  was worse than old, it was rotten, spoiled, disgusting."
336,Yxxgf_bT76Bi_Vuf4iZUpA,1,"We were told they were changing out the lettuce, they did, with more rotten lettuce."
336,Yxxgf_bT76Bi_Vuf4iZUpA,1,The beets were so bad I spit them out.
336,Yxxgf_bT76Bi_Vuf4iZUpA,1,"The waitress brought my husband's food out and I explained the salad bar was bad, and that I actually had to spit food out."
336,Yxxgf_bT76Bi_Vuf4iZUpA,1,"She said ""oh really"" and walked off, never to be seen again."
336,Yxxgf_bT76Bi_Vuf4iZUpA,1,My husband's sliders were pucks of something.
336,Yxxgf_bT76Bi_Vuf4iZUpA,1,"Thankfully we got Brian, the best thing about this place, who brought the manager."
336,Yxxgf_bT76Bi_Vuf4iZUpA,1,"Obviously we told her what happened she offered new food, yeah no."
336,Yxxgf_bT76Bi_Vuf4iZUpA,1,If you are going to this restaurant for any other reason than to speak to Brian I would rethink.
337,9f5yaymNnIz4PvsDP6IoBA,1,Absolutely do not come if you need service.
337,9f5yaymNnIz4PvsDP6IoBA,1,We got salad bar and water(one glass).
337,9f5yaymNnIz4PvsDP6IoBA,1,"No ticket, no service."
337,9f5yaymNnIz4PvsDP6IoBA,1,The doors will close soon.
338,Q3p4yHeXLs7hznVbJy5_xA,1,The salad bar was good!!
338,Q3p4yHeXLs7hznVbJy5_xA,1,"Now, the rest of the story...."
338,Q3p4yHeXLs7hznVbJy5_xA,1,I don't know where to begin with this travesty of service we experienced.
338,Q3p4yHeXLs7hznVbJy5_xA,1,I'm still astonished at the sheer indifference to the BASIC customer related skills.
338,Q3p4yHeXLs7hznVbJy5_xA,1,We received a NOTICEABLY dirty highchair which I cleaned with paper towels from the bathroom and my alcohol solution; we did the same with the table since it was sticky; no napkins offered with the meals so back to the brown napkins AGAIN; I received cutlery because I ordered the salad bar...no one else at the table did because she decided that they didn't need any.
338,Q3p4yHeXLs7hznVbJy5_xA,1,I'm BEYOND BELIEF at the WORST EXPERIENCE we've had in decades.
338,Q3p4yHeXLs7hznVbJy5_xA,1,What happened to the BurgerPalace franchise?
338,Q3p4yHeXLs7hznVbJy5_xA,1,Read my review and heed my warning.
339,oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2,I haven't been here since before the COVID 19 shut down.
339,oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2, So it has been a good 15 months or more.
339,oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2," Now, I know the pandemic was brutally on restaurants, but this restaurant managed to survive."
339,oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2, Warning they are short help.
339,oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2, Upon walking in the bar has a massive table filled with to go bags.
339,oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2, Delivery and pick up.
339,oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2, The employee guarding the food acknowledge me and that was it.
339,oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2,  Asked for a table and received a blank stare.
339,oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2, I waited a few minutes until a women appeared and asked how many.
339,oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2, She seats me in a both with a terrible chirping sound going off above.
339,oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2, 
339,oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2,"So kind of alarm or warning sound, so now I am thinking what is going on here.  Dinners are in their booths carrying on no one notices this sound.  Waitress comes over and says, "" I am moving you down, so you do not have to hear the alarm while you dine.""  Apparently, service had not arrived and they were working and seating dinners while this alarm was chirping all day."
339,oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2,"Carpet in the dining section I was in was worn and the rubber backing was showing and sticking to the souls of my sandals.   They still over the salad bar, but there were no takers."
339,oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2, Wise decision.
339,oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2, Pandemic is not over.
339,oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2, ONE waitress for the entire waitress.
339,oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2, This women was doing a great job.
339,oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2," She was attentive, and making sure she made up for the day's situation."
339,oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2," Cook was slow, or did not have help, because it took awhile for the triple prime cheese burger and fries to arrive."
339,oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2, But it was hot.
339,oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2," If you are going to this location, have some patience's as the restaurant is under staffed and so of the employees are dedicated to good service."
340,mXYOOHe3VXS5Jfd7iu5v-g,1,Took a long time to get a cheeseburger only to get a cold hamburger and fries.
340,mXYOOHe3VXS5Jfd7iu5v-g,1,Then the waitress had an attitude about my daughters cheeseburger not having pickles.
340,mXYOOHe3VXS5Jfd7iu5v-g,1, Then the manager came over to try to smooth things over by asking if she could fix it by making another one.
340,mXYOOHe3VXS5Jfd7iu5v-g,1,Hell no I'm not waiting another 1/2 hour for another cold cheeseburger.
341,OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,Very disappointed.
341,OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,"Went on easter sunday, they did not have enough help to have us to be able to eat dinner."
341,OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,I was like ok.
341,OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,We left.
341,OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,"Came back on Monday me and my kids, was seated quickly."
341,OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,Ordered food and drinks took a very long time to get our food.
341,OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,My son's cheeseburger had no cheese!
341,OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,"So I waited on waiter to let him know, he said he picked up wrong burger."
341,OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,Took over 30 minutes to bring a piece of cold cheese on the plate.
341,OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,Why not have them re make the burger so cheese could have been melted.
341,OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,Noticed that the table close to me the waiter kept forgetting their food orders and adding things they told them to leave off.
341,OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,Well this doesn't bit the apple.
341,OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,I ordered zucchini it was so greasy I could use it to fry chicken.
341,OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,I ordered ribs they were cooked to hard couldn't cut it with the knife.
341,OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,So I let waiter know he sent manager out she replaced both well when it came back out looked as if someone ate the meat off of the rib it was just bones.
341,OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,I just threw it in trash when I left.
341,OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,Waiters fingers were in my fries as he carried my plate.
341,OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,I used to love eating dinner at this place everyday.
341,OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,Now this experience has definitely turned my yes into a definitely no.
342,YbkH_YiLRmJPV5mbaXndvg,1,"If you plan on going to get curbside pickup, forget it."
342,YbkH_YiLRmJPV5mbaXndvg,1,You can call the number on the sign and the phone will ring until  you hear the voice mail pick up and then hang up.
342,YbkH_YiLRmJPV5mbaXndvg,1,So I thought they must be busy so I go inside and when I did the staff was just standing around.
342,YbkH_YiLRmJPV5mbaXndvg,1,The girl at the door didn't even acknowledge me.
342,YbkH_YiLRmJPV5mbaXndvg,1,"So if I could give ""0"" stars for device I would."
342,YbkH_YiLRmJPV5mbaXndvg,1,Get the food home and it was burnt and tasteless.
342,YbkH_YiLRmJPV5mbaXndvg,1,This is one of the worst restaurants and staff in Florence.
342,YbkH_YiLRmJPV5mbaXndvg,1,Avoid at all costs.
343,I84GXC7nL0jnQ03AbvIpaw,1,We had a party of five and all of our orders were mixed up on each individuals plate.
343,I84GXC7nL0jnQ03AbvIpaw,1,One of our buddies asked for Mayo for his burger and received tarter sauce.
343,I84GXC7nL0jnQ03AbvIpaw,1,"They did take the burger off for the inconvenience, but we all had loaded fries with cheese and the cheese was not melted."
343,I84GXC7nL0jnQ03AbvIpaw,1,"Another individual in our party received a loaded baked potato with only sour cream on it, no bacon or cheese so It wasn't even loaded."
343,I84GXC7nL0jnQ03AbvIpaw,1,All in all we will not be going back to this restaurant.
344,-H7ViSr9CU7KF563e3LG6g,1,Stopped for dinner at approximately 7:30pm on a Saturday.
344,-H7ViSr9CU7KF563e3LG6g,1,Most tables were empty and a majority of the empty tables were dirty.
344,-H7ViSr9CU7KF563e3LG6g,1,The floor was covered with pieces of food.
344,-H7ViSr9CU7KF563e3LG6g,1,We were seated in a booth that appeared to have been wiped off with a dirty rag.
344,-H7ViSr9CU7KF563e3LG6g,1,It was 10-15 minutes before any wait staff asked us for our drink order.
344,-H7ViSr9CU7KF563e3LG6g,1,"Once we ordered, I opened my napkin/silverware and the utensils were very dirty with caked on filth."
344,-H7ViSr9CU7KF563e3LG6g,1,My husband's silverware was even more dirty.
344,-H7ViSr9CU7KF563e3LG6g,1,That was all we could take.
344,-H7ViSr9CU7KF563e3LG6g,1,We cancelled our order and left.
344,-H7ViSr9CU7KF563e3LG6g,1,It was gross!
345,pPp_oSqGJgft83s14ePoyg,1,Our sampler was delicious.
345,pPp_oSqGJgft83s14ePoyg,1,Mine and my husband's chicken BBQ salad was terrible . Lettuce should be in the trash.
345,pPp_oSqGJgft83s14ePoyg,1,Our waiter Ryan was amazing.
346,pL3_Q6vrrlwQWfR5Ph9vfw,1,Awful.
346,pL3_Q6vrrlwQWfR5Ph9vfw,1,We arrived to the restaurant and were seated immediately.
346,pL3_Q6vrrlwQWfR5Ph9vfw,1,We were the first to sit down.
346,pL3_Q6vrrlwQWfR5Ph9vfw,1,"Our appetizer was delivered to the wrong table, and we had to wait 15 minutes for a refill."
346,pL3_Q6vrrlwQWfR5Ph9vfw,1,"Then when our appetizers did arrive, one had been dropped on the floor."
346,pL3_Q6vrrlwQWfR5Ph9vfw,1,Every table around us that got in after us got food first.
346,pL3_Q6vrrlwQWfR5Ph9vfw,1,"When we did get our food, the chicken was stiff and the cheese on the loaded fries was coagulated."
346,pL3_Q6vrrlwQWfR5Ph9vfw,1,Never going back again.
347,ZUdMCF80STqaJ_guDTqWkg,1,The waitress was amazing!
347,ZUdMCF80STqaJ_guDTqWkg,1,I wouldn't feed the food to a dog!
347,ZUdMCF80STqaJ_guDTqWkg,1,Do not order the ribeye steak!
347,ZUdMCF80STqaJ_guDTqWkg,1,"Tough, fatty, gross."
347,ZUdMCF80STqaJ_guDTqWkg,1,The food itself has zero flavor and was drowning in grease!
347,ZUdMCF80STqaJ_guDTqWkg,1,I went to a BurgerPalace several years ago and it was good.
347,ZUdMCF80STqaJ_guDTqWkg,1,This place should just close their doors awful!
348,QrHeXp9c9VaokZmdaFsTIA,5,Most restaurants offer nothing more than a side salad and a Caesar salad or a wilted piece of lettuce on your burger.
348,QrHeXp9c9VaokZmdaFsTIA,5,RT gives you a large salad bar that allows you to select the veggies you enjoy.
348,QrHeXp9c9VaokZmdaFsTIA,5,No other chain restaurant other than the buffet joints offer that and the buffet joints can't match the the freshness and quality of the RT offerings.
348,QrHeXp9c9VaokZmdaFsTIA,5,"Their service is great, restrooms are very clean, french fries are delicious."
348,QrHeXp9c9VaokZmdaFsTIA,5,"All in all, a nice change from the usual chain restaurants."
349,UUwztUTcNrB0lDkCsTCOtg,5,"Even though there were only 2 servers on a Friday night, we sat in the bar and Zach was amazing."
349,UUwztUTcNrB0lDkCsTCOtg,5," Food tasted good, service was fast and efficient."
350,viVE1oxOQJQwQsPRLK2qSA,1,We sat at our table for 25 minutes and no one even took our drink order.
350,viVE1oxOQJQwQsPRLK2qSA,1,There were two more groups and both of them were dissatisfied.
350,viVE1oxOQJQwQsPRLK2qSA,1,"One group said they have been waiting for there food for a hour and didn't get anything, and another group they denied service to, They weren't even busy, AT ALL!"
350,viVE1oxOQJQwQsPRLK2qSA,1,It was ridiculous.
350,viVE1oxOQJQwQsPRLK2qSA,1,If I could give them 0 stars I would.
351,rRhJdrfkPvaGrktSIWvEeg,1,Don't waste your time here.
351,rRhJdrfkPvaGrktSIWvEeg,1,The bartender was the only one waiting on tables at 6pm.
351,rRhJdrfkPvaGrktSIWvEeg,1,The chicken strips were the size of a quarter and the mashed potatoes taste like instant mashed potatoes made in a microwave
352,8Fox1HBunn-CMfnBVp0-jA,5,"Festus gem for great food, service & friendly staff!"
352,8Fox1HBunn-CMfnBVp0-jA,5,Salad bar was bountiful and fresh!
352,8Fox1HBunn-CMfnBVp0-jA,5,"Enjoyed the salmon, it was flavorful and cooked to glistening perfection."
352,8Fox1HBunn-CMfnBVp0-jA,5,Restaurant manager Jane Vogt greeted & seated every customer!
352,8Fox1HBunn-CMfnBVp0-jA,5, Exceptionally clean and the atmosphere is well suited for anyone who wishes to enjoy a meal out.
352,8Fox1HBunn-CMfnBVp0-jA,5,Carry out also available so you can't go wrong either way.
352,8Fox1HBunn-CMfnBVp0-jA,5, I will certainly be back!
353,ivwgIb4rnAsCx_Id2coF5w,2,"Website says opened at 11am... doors locked, lights off...."
353,ivwgIb4rnAsCx_Id2coF5w,2,But the salad bar was stocked.
353,ivwgIb4rnAsCx_Id2coF5w,2,Really annoying since it was raining pretty hard and we got soaked for nothing.
354,aopmjS9Oa_oWTT_DwWMQoQ,3,My husband and I went for the 2 for 1 fajitas.
354,aopmjS9Oa_oWTT_DwWMQoQ,3,Little did we know they were going to take one order of fajitas and turn it in to two.
354,aopmjS9Oa_oWTT_DwWMQoQ,3,Our plates looked NOTHING like the picture in the add.
354,aopmjS9Oa_oWTT_DwWMQoQ,3,"When I questioned management her answer was ""we just serve what they send us."""
354,aopmjS9Oa_oWTT_DwWMQoQ,3,"Notice the cheese, sour cream and lettuce in the add?"
354,aopmjS9Oa_oWTT_DwWMQoQ,3,None on our plates.
354,aopmjS9Oa_oWTT_DwWMQoQ,3,Chicken breast nicely sliced in add?
354,aopmjS9Oa_oWTT_DwWMQoQ,3,Small chunks on our plates.
354,aopmjS9Oa_oWTT_DwWMQoQ,3,Very disappointing.
355,G7RNy1Eipfax9qtbnYu7ig,1,Don't  bother wasting your time at their Festus location.
355,G7RNy1Eipfax9qtbnYu7ig,1,We went and they had one server for the whole restaurant as well as being the bartender.
355,G7RNy1Eipfax9qtbnYu7ig,1,They had a party of 11 and told us there would be a long wait and told another lady 25 minutes.
355,G7RNy1Eipfax9qtbnYu7ig,1,You could not possibly get waited on in time if you only had a limited lunch break for work.
355,G7RNy1Eipfax9qtbnYu7ig,1,Last time we went all we  wanted was the salad bar and they told us it would be a long wait.
355,G7RNy1Eipfax9qtbnYu7ig,1,It's  no wonder BurgerPalace is closing locations.
355,G7RNy1Eipfax9qtbnYu7ig,1,Terrible customer service.
356,Ud32RLiaOXRpG1Fc1_9pgw,1,Just a terrible place to eat.
356,Ud32RLiaOXRpG1Fc1_9pgw,1,"Use to be very nice the salad bar was empty,I had to get our silverware from the bar, no refills, waited over a hour for a hamburger and tater tots "" the waiter ask if we got our food yet"""
356,Ud32RLiaOXRpG1Fc1_9pgw,1,"I said no he came back and said "" Oh it's ready in back I don't know why it's not out here I said so it's cold oh no it's been sitting under a heat lamp I said so its dried out."
356,Ud32RLiaOXRpG1Fc1_9pgw,1,Got it and the bun was hard and the meat was raw never eat here again
357,30v3-6IAdObcIpYrqgyvhQ,1,If I could give zero stars I would.
357,30v3-6IAdObcIpYrqgyvhQ,1, 
357,30v3-6IAdObcIpYrqgyvhQ,1,Stood there for 10 minutes waiting to be seated.
357,30v3-6IAdObcIpYrqgyvhQ,1, Someone walked past us and didn't even acknowledge us and never came back.
357,30v3-6IAdObcIpYrqgyvhQ,1," Finally, we and 4 other groups left."
358,nXG84TetMCmx8Tk_FlLUvQ,2,This must be a place to go in person because I ordered to go and it was not good!!
358,nXG84TetMCmx8Tk_FlLUvQ,2,Shrimp Parmesan pasta was like eating oil and tasteless and a lot smaller portion than you would get in store the amount didn't even cover the to go container bottom and it wasn't a large container.
358,nXG84TetMCmx8Tk_FlLUvQ,2,My steak was very over cooked and potato had a weird after taste.
358,nXG84TetMCmx8Tk_FlLUvQ,2,For a 100.00 meal it was pretty bad.
358,nXG84TetMCmx8Tk_FlLUvQ,2,Not sure how they are still in business closing at 8pm and serving food of this quality.
358,nXG84TetMCmx8Tk_FlLUvQ,2,Sorry BurgerPalace I feel like your days are numbered before your out of business.
359,9BZB3w9i0V-Ij4THBnZM3w,5,best place ever super yummy salad bar and food great service and friendly staff i will always return thanks ruby tuesday you are awesome
360,b7z8pPE6OvIEL7vyVEpoTw,5,"Husband was in the mood for pasta, but in Saraland, there's a serious lack of options for pasta."
360,b7z8pPE6OvIEL7vyVEpoTw,5,Then I remembered BurgerPalace so here we are.
360,b7z8pPE6OvIEL7vyVEpoTw,5,Staff are all wearing masks.
360,b7z8pPE6OvIEL7vyVEpoTw,5,Guests are seated spaced apart.
360,b7z8pPE6OvIEL7vyVEpoTw,5,"The salad bar was open, but I didn't get anything from it."
360,b7z8pPE6OvIEL7vyVEpoTw,5,We got the appetizer sampler - mozzarella sticks were amazing.
360,b7z8pPE6OvIEL7vyVEpoTw,5,"The pretzels were sooo soft, and the spinach dip was delicious."
360,b7z8pPE6OvIEL7vyVEpoTw,5,"It didn't look like we would have enough chips, but it turned out to be exactly the right amount."
360,b7z8pPE6OvIEL7vyVEpoTw,5,"My meal was chicken tenders, fries, and corn."
360,b7z8pPE6OvIEL7vyVEpoTw,5,"The chicken tasted fresh and hand battered, not frozen."
360,b7z8pPE6OvIEL7vyVEpoTw,5,"The corn was very buttery, and the fries were hot and salted just right."
360,b7z8pPE6OvIEL7vyVEpoTw,5,I ate every bit of it.
360,b7z8pPE6OvIEL7vyVEpoTw,5,Husband got some kind of shrimp sausage pasta.
360,b7z8pPE6OvIEL7vyVEpoTw,5,It isn't on the regular menu.
360,b7z8pPE6OvIEL7vyVEpoTw,5,It was a special.
360,b7z8pPE6OvIEL7vyVEpoTw,5,"He wasn't a huge fan of the sauce, but liked it otherwise."
360,b7z8pPE6OvIEL7vyVEpoTw,5,"I had really hoped to get dessert since the menu has a lot of mouth watering options, but I was stuffed."
360,b7z8pPE6OvIEL7vyVEpoTw,5,I'll have to come back and have dessert first next time!
361,V3yePQOssQl2s0ghH-Ld2w,4,BurgerPalace is always a safe go to.
361,V3yePQOssQl2s0ghH-Ld2w,4,I'm a big fan of the salad bar but I wish they would bring back the cottage cheese.
361,V3yePQOssQl2s0ghH-Ld2w,4,For lunch I usually stick with the salad bar and broccoli and cheese soup.
361,V3yePQOssQl2s0ghH-Ld2w,4,It never disappoints.
361,V3yePQOssQl2s0ghH-Ld2w,4,"For dinner, I prefer their steak."
361,V3yePQOssQl2s0ghH-Ld2w,4,"Believe it or not, their steaks are pretty good."
361,V3yePQOssQl2s0ghH-Ld2w,4,We sat in the bar area and our waitress was very attentive.
362,6lnHRURh73cTaBbQ5EOVdw,1,Hadn't been to a BurgerPalace in a longtime.
362,6lnHRURh73cTaBbQ5EOVdw,1,Now I see why.
362,6lnHRURh73cTaBbQ5EOVdw,1,Wait time was long for lunch time and wait staff very inattentive.
362,6lnHRURh73cTaBbQ5EOVdw,1,Not once did they come back to check and see if everything was OkHad to ask for basic things.
362,6lnHRURh73cTaBbQ5EOVdw,1, 
362,6lnHRURh73cTaBbQ5EOVdw,1,"Mustard, Ketchup or Mayo."
362,6lnHRURh73cTaBbQ5EOVdw,1,The two most prompt things they did was bring water and the bill.
362,6lnHRURh73cTaBbQ5EOVdw,1,Every time they bought something to the table I told the waiter Thank you.
362,6lnHRURh73cTaBbQ5EOVdw,1,Had a Bacon Cheese Burger with no Bacon after mentioning it to waiter they responded they didn't have any slices of Bacon so they put Bacon Chips very very sparsely at that.
362,6lnHRURh73cTaBbQ5EOVdw,1,So we had them take it off the Bill.
362,6lnHRURh73cTaBbQ5EOVdw,1,Tipped usual 20% still no Thank you for coming or come see us again soon.
362,6lnHRURh73cTaBbQ5EOVdw,1,Just felt like they don't care and the Food was just Ok.
362,6lnHRURh73cTaBbQ5EOVdw,1,I can do Ok at home without even trying.
362,6lnHRURh73cTaBbQ5EOVdw,1,Want be back anytime soon.
362,6lnHRURh73cTaBbQ5EOVdw,1,RB Tues. on 12mi in Novi Got to do much better.
363,Kz5x6A2uvz143aaZoJvGHA,1,The Saucy Hen doesn't exist when you search for the business after you have an issue with your DoorDash order and come to find out it's actually BurgerPalace scamming customers.
363,Kz5x6A2uvz143aaZoJvGHA,1,THEN when you leave this review: Saucy chicken sandwich had no sauce.
363,Kz5x6A2uvz143aaZoJvGHA,1,"Ordered tots on the side, received ten."
363,Kz5x6A2uvz143aaZoJvGHA,1,Ten actual tots.
363,Kz5x6A2uvz143aaZoJvGHA,1,"And for $4 mac-n-cheese,the container was barely 1/4 full."
363,Kz5x6A2uvz143aaZoJvGHA,1,Y'allshould be ashamed of yourselves but alsoshame on me for not checking reviews forthis scam......
363,Kz5x6A2uvz143aaZoJvGHA,1,the restaurant blocks you on DoorDash.
363,Kz5x6A2uvz143aaZoJvGHA,1,"Shame, shame, shame on you."
363,Kz5x6A2uvz143aaZoJvGHA,1,"How about instead of putting out bad food under a fictitious name (might want to change your photos up by the way, since they're the same on your current menu and all), you might want to own up for your actions and do better."
363,Kz5x6A2uvz143aaZoJvGHA,1,What a scam.
364,mclndYz6z4v5PadEZLrWqg,5,"Wonderful food, kids and adults really enjoyed this place."
364,mclndYz6z4v5PadEZLrWqg,5,Highly recommend you stop here.
364,mclndYz6z4v5PadEZLrWqg,5,It's on the way from Destin to the airport.
365,X--QUmiFWd9-eNe-l2g8Kw,1,Me and my wife ate lunch there today.
365,X--QUmiFWd9-eNe-l2g8Kw,1,We had 2 salad bars and had steak fajitas and shrimp fajitas to take home for dinner.
365,X--QUmiFWd9-eNe-l2g8Kw,1,"Upon opening the box that the shrimp fajitas were in, bam big dead cockroach staring at us."
365,X--QUmiFWd9-eNe-l2g8Kw,1,I called them up to tell them about it and the manager tells me it could of came from anywhere.
365,X--QUmiFWd9-eNe-l2g8Kw,1,"I proceeded to tell him I wasn't calling to get my money back, just to inform him of the situation just to see what he would say."
365,X--QUmiFWd9-eNe-l2g8Kw,1,That's when he tells me it could have gotten in there when we left.
365,X--QUmiFWd9-eNe-l2g8Kw,1,It's a shame because we liked going there to eat.
365,X--QUmiFWd9-eNe-l2g8Kw,1,I will not ever go in there and eat again.
365,X--QUmiFWd9-eNe-l2g8Kw,1,Freakin gross.
365,X--QUmiFWd9-eNe-l2g8Kw,1,Made me sick to my stomach.
366,vgYf-hoYTCyUl0aSA7QEcQ,2,"Ordered a ribeye medium well, came to me mooing."
366,vgYf-hoYTCyUl0aSA7QEcQ,2, It happens.
366,vgYf-hoYTCyUl0aSA7QEcQ,2," I sent it back, and I'm ~99% sure the kitchen crew microwaved it, very rubbery and too quick to have been put on the grille."
366,vgYf-hoYTCyUl0aSA7QEcQ,2," But something else is making my stomach gurgle, not sure, but thinking it was the salad bar.  I'm done with BurgerPalace not what it used to be."
367,cDTvCrNMrRun7-W60NiMiA,3,It's just okay.... Nothing to get excited about.
367,cDTvCrNMrRun7-W60NiMiA,3,Average food but definitely overpriced.
367,cDTvCrNMrRun7-W60NiMiA,3, Best part of the visit was our server.
367,cDTvCrNMrRun7-W60NiMiA,3, She was so friendly!
368,PQWjXTcAzXulBPWeBv6yTw,1,Quite a few of us ordered lunch from this location today while we were working.
368,PQWjXTcAzXulBPWeBv6yTw,1,"Very shortly after eating, 3 of us got pretty sick."
368,PQWjXTcAzXulBPWeBv6yTw,1,"One had the Bourbon chicken and mashed potatoes, one had chicken tenders and fries, and I had the tots appetizer."
368,PQWjXTcAzXulBPWeBv6yTw,1,"We are not sure what it was in the food that made us sick, but we have been pretty sick since about 15-20 minutes after eating."
368,PQWjXTcAzXulBPWeBv6yTw,1,"I will never order from this BurgerPalace again...it was one of those awful, sick experiences."
369,atICMujnUDlNVkLwZUmE9g,2,I'm still amazed that this place is still open.
369,atICMujnUDlNVkLwZUmE9g,2,Had lunch there a few days ago and the food although descent was WAY over priced.
369,atICMujnUDlNVkLwZUmE9g,2,"The appearance of the restaurant was the same as 20 years ago, but back then there were patrons."
369,atICMujnUDlNVkLwZUmE9g,2,"On this last visit i only saw half dozen people there, and it should have been packed with the lunch crowd as we're all the others in town."
369,atICMujnUDlNVkLwZUmE9g,2,I won't be returning when they're are plenty of other restaurants in town.
370,3Ag377oif8derpoxhFeT7A,3,Ordered full rack of ribs to go and they were very dry and tough.
370,3Ag377oif8derpoxhFeT7A,3,I think they were cooked and shelfed under the warming light for too many hours
370,3Ag377oif8derpoxhFeT7A,3,This is the second time I got dry tough ribs.
370,3Ag377oif8derpoxhFeT7A,3,"Not sure I will order again from BurgerPalace To be fair I have gotten delicious, moist and tender fresh ribs many times before from Tuesday."
370,3Ag377oif8derpoxhFeT7A,3,"Must be a bad management decision to serve old dry ribs to take out customers, figuring they wont bring them back."
371,Tl7TtgcNM0Uy3qgCf9_mag,4,My friends and I keep this place busy!
371,Tl7TtgcNM0Uy3qgCf9_mag,4,Good food and the staff are friendly and helpful.
371,Tl7TtgcNM0Uy3qgCf9_mag,4,Food quality is always on point.
371,Tl7TtgcNM0Uy3qgCf9_mag,4,Definitely get the ribs.
371,Tl7TtgcNM0Uy3qgCf9_mag,4,"I recommend the Texas dry rub, and go ahead and order the full rack."
371,Tl7TtgcNM0Uy3qgCf9_mag,4,Cannot breakup the whole family and leave the other six behind.
371,Tl7TtgcNM0Uy3qgCf9_mag,4,NO RIBS LEFT BEHIND!
372,Ak5XUM1ED40rRxfSIYa1vg,3,Great place to get better than fast food after work.
372,Ak5XUM1ED40rRxfSIYa1vg,3,They give a discount to the Best Western next door.
372,Ak5XUM1ED40rRxfSIYa1vg,3,The food is usually better than average for what you'd expect from BurgerPalace
372,Ak5XUM1ED40rRxfSIYa1vg,3,They always have room for seating.
372,Ak5XUM1ED40rRxfSIYa1vg,3,The wait staff and bartenders are friendly.
372,Ak5XUM1ED40rRxfSIYa1vg,3,It doesn't take long to be a regular here.
372,Ak5XUM1ED40rRxfSIYa1vg,3,Well managed chain restaurant.
373,b4LHSn8ERUNvkyh7NS2_5w,1,Ordered a burger for takeout got home took a bite outside cooked.
373,b4LHSn8ERUNvkyh7NS2_5w,1,Inside was raw called the store to get hung up on issue was never resolved will not be back.
374,r-9Z-3bnPK1pxiR6LTHrQA,4,Untappd
374,r-9Z-3bnPK1pxiR6LTHrQA,4,241I gotta show some chain loveFood and beer were greatI decided to go to Lupulin in Sioux Falls to get their Untappd Badge.
374,r-9Z-3bnPK1pxiR6LTHrQA,4,Little did I know that BurgerPalace next door has their own Untappd Badge.
374,r-9Z-3bnPK1pxiR6LTHrQA,4,I am not aware of any other BurgerPalace's that have one.
374,r-9Z-3bnPK1pxiR6LTHrQA,4,They also have an Untappd Board to boot.
374,r-9Z-3bnPK1pxiR6LTHrQA,4,Get your name up there in lights!Bartender
374,r-9Z-3bnPK1pxiR6LTHrQA,4,was super friendly and attentive.
374,r-9Z-3bnPK1pxiR6LTHrQA,4,My food was solid.
374,r-9Z-3bnPK1pxiR6LTHrQA,4,No complaints whatsoever.
374,r-9Z-3bnPK1pxiR6LTHrQA,4,I got the New Orleans Seafood dish which is Tilapia with shrimp in a creamy sauce.
374,r-9Z-3bnPK1pxiR6LTHrQA,4,Normally comes with zucchini but I was allowed to substitute broccoli.
374,r-9Z-3bnPK1pxiR6LTHrQA,4,Would definitely get it again.
374,r-9Z-3bnPK1pxiR6LTHrQA,4,So get off your high horse.
374,r-9Z-3bnPK1pxiR6LTHrQA,4,Chains need patronizing too!
375,kbjaNUs6Ra1ASc7OR7FyFQ,5,"Spent 4hrs on the Highway today and settled into our hotel, and then we took a walk over to the BurgerPalace"
375,kbjaNUs6Ra1ASc7OR7FyFQ,5,I can't explain how attentive the staff was and how great their courtesies were; it was that good.
375,kbjaNUs6Ra1ASc7OR7FyFQ,5,This is probably one of the best places I've been to in a long while that had it all together from all angles.
375,kbjaNUs6Ra1ASc7OR7FyFQ,5,Everything was clean/immaculate and the food was delicious.
375,kbjaNUs6Ra1ASc7OR7FyFQ,5,They did such a great job.
375,kbjaNUs6Ra1ASc7OR7FyFQ,5,Couldn't have asked for a better rest stop.
376,Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,"Haven't been here in a long time, but decided to go because of the great salad bar."
376,Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,We weren't disappointed in that aspect.
376,Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,It has been remodeled and is a very nice place.
376,Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,I was with my friend who was in town for dialysis and she can't eat a lot of things so ordered a plain burger well done.
376,Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,My mother ordered a fancy burger medium well.
376,Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,When they came my friends was pink in the middle and my moms was rare.
376,Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,My friend sent hers back.
376,Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,She has been a cook for years and so I asked her what the plan was in a situation like this.
376,Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,She said you make them a new burger.
376,Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,After 10 minutes her burger came back on a very hot plate.
376,Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,We looked at each other and knew exactly what happened.
376,Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,The cook nuked it.
376,Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,And what proof do we have?
376,Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,Her bun was rock hard.
376,Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,"Add into this the waitress looked like she'd just been flogged in the kitchen-bawling face, tears, etc. so not sure what happened back there but it wasn't her fault."
376,Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,So not very happy with this visit.
377,wtNliIB8_ZpWTgQBAKWpzw,5,Great experience !! Great wait staff made it enjoyable... oh and the food was yummy too!!!
377,wtNliIB8_ZpWTgQBAKWpzw,5,Kudos to Bailey!!!!
378,ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,A must!!
378,ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,I ordered online and picked up food to go.
378,ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,"I had a gift card, so consequently I went inside to purchase my food."
378,ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,"The restaurant has remodeled within the past year, and the place looks AMAZING!"
378,ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,"When I entered, the hostess told me I should go to the bar to get my takeout order."
378,ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,"The bartender was friendly, pleasant, polite, just exceptional."
378,ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,I have to take a minute & stop to tell you about the actual BurgerPalace restaurant building itself.
378,ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,(Granted I didn't see the ENTIRE inside--but enough) Totally Beautiful!
378,ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,The atmosphere and ambience was so cool--sort of a 'warm-fun-classic-happy style' I would call it.
378,ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5, If there is such a thing.
378,ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,The lighting was great...
378,ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,And who notices & comments on a restaurants lighting?
378,ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5, (Not me usually) but I still can't believe how awesome it was to walk into that place.
378,ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,Some thing about it was warm and inviting and welcoming.
378,ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,When I got home and had the food--even better.
378,ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,I had steak and a baked potato...
378,ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,And it was to die for.
378,ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,I haven't had BurgerPalace in a long time and I am definitely going to change that-because obviously they have changed some things--- and the changes have been good!
378,ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5, 
378,ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,Try it for yourself.
379,p0PNhev5xROil_tJEDs-9Q,4,I'm not normally a fan of chain restaurants.
379,p0PNhev5xROil_tJEDs-9Q,4,They often disappoint.
379,p0PNhev5xROil_tJEDs-9Q,4,"However, I'm going to give this BurgerPalace a 4 because, not only was my fish well cooked and actually flavorful, but they had an open salad bar."
379,p0PNhev5xROil_tJEDs-9Q,4,"You may think this isn't a huge feat, especially for a BurgerPalace, but during COVID, this was a very welcome surprise."
379,p0PNhev5xROil_tJEDs-9Q,4,"Before anyone gets cross eyed and offended that they would have a salad bar open during this time, they took several precautions to maintain, at least what I consider, an adequate level of safety."
379,p0PNhev5xROil_tJEDs-9Q,4, I give them kudos for making that amenity available.
379,p0PNhev5xROil_tJEDs-9Q,4,Especially since we were a family of weary travelers that had been in the road for a few days and this hit the spot
379,p0PNhev5xROil_tJEDs-9Q,4,.
380,ZwOLrX2q0q2RYs6bFJHEcA,5,Remodel is really nice!
380,ZwOLrX2q0q2RYs6bFJHEcA,5,"The Food was great, salad bar was delicious as usual!!"
380,ZwOLrX2q0q2RYs6bFJHEcA,5,The service was fast and friendly.
381,ZoXFHor_ALyVtr9lf-hXWQ,1,Went to try the brunch today.
381,ZoXFHor_ALyVtr9lf-hXWQ,1,It was mediocre at best - salad bar is always pretty good.
381,ZoXFHor_ALyVtr9lf-hXWQ,1,The part that really disappointed me is when I had an omelette made to order and I got about a quarter of the way through it and found a short black hair stuck in it.
381,ZoXFHor_ALyVtr9lf-hXWQ,1,"When I brought it to the waitress's attention she just said, ""ewe, that's gross.""  Nothing else was done for us, not even a manager sent over to apologize."
381,ZoXFHor_ALyVtr9lf-hXWQ,1,Just paid the bill and left knowing we won't go back.
381,ZoXFHor_ALyVtr9lf-hXWQ,1,That's poor customer service all around.
382,qgVbbxuv3AEh39OWGu7Exw,5,Salad bar was amazing as always.
382,qgVbbxuv3AEh39OWGu7Exw,5,"Good drink, good music and nice selection on the TV."
382,qgVbbxuv3AEh39OWGu7Exw,5,Drinks are always on point and Desire V (our server) is always entertaining!!!
383,3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,We ordered online last night.
383,3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,I got the email telling me what time our meals would be ready and what to do for curbside pickup.
383,3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,When I arrived at the restaurant I called the number on the sign (same one as in the email) to let them know I was there to bring out our meals.
383,3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,It rang for quite a long time.
383,3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,Then someone hung up.
383,3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,I tried two more times with the same result.
383,3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,Someone would pick up the phone then immediately hang up!
383,3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,I went inside and NO ONE was at the pickup station.
383,3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,I went to the hostess who looked at me like I had two heads and sent me to the bar.
383,3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,There were three take out orders on the bar.
383,3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,It took a few minutes before a bartender recognized I was there.
383,3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,Then the excuses started!
383,3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,I finally got our meals  and not a single employee apologized.
383,3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,Not one!
383,3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,The hostess is oblivious and the rest of the employees obviously don't care.
383,3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,Live and learn I guess.
383,3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,The first and last time we will order or visit the Elizabeth City BurgerPalace Tuesday!Stay away!
384,H_Gaz1rAyzizsPmMxU7rig,1,"After sitting there for five minutes with the staff all looking over at us, multiple people finally came to the table."
384,H_Gaz1rAyzizsPmMxU7rig,1, The bartender who was getting off pointed out to me that she was off the clock.
384,H_Gaz1rAyzizsPmMxU7rig,1," I pointed out to her that if she were off the clock, she shouldn't be behind the bar and why."
384,H_Gaz1rAyzizsPmMxU7rig,1," After she proceeded to argue with me, we left!  Smart move after reading all the reviews!!"
385,0BpqkAFUoAkjL-I8NEZ_Ww,3,Not a bad dining option at all considering the area.
385,0BpqkAFUoAkjL-I8NEZ_Ww,3,"If you find yourself around here and happen to be in Horseheads' Arnot Mall, you'll notice that the dining options are slim."
385,0BpqkAFUoAkjL-I8NEZ_Ww,3,Very slim.
385,0BpqkAFUoAkjL-I8NEZ_Ww,3,"Make your way through the mall, through the nearly non-existent food court, and you'll realize that your best food option in the mall may very well be this BurgerPalace Tuesday."
385,0BpqkAFUoAkjL-I8NEZ_Ww,3,"Long story short, food is decent."
385,0BpqkAFUoAkjL-I8NEZ_Ww,3,Service is fast and friendly.
385,0BpqkAFUoAkjL-I8NEZ_Ww,3,It's fast casual.
385,0BpqkAFUoAkjL-I8NEZ_Ww,3,"Nothing more, nothing less."
386,03d4VUFWlAR7PssD_fbLdg,3,"Food was good, not exceptional, but still good but a tad over priced for the quality."
386,03d4VUFWlAR7PssD_fbLdg,3, We sat by the windows and it was pretty cold but we suffered through.
386,03d4VUFWlAR7PssD_fbLdg,3,"We were greeted by our server promptly, so we were off to a good start then we ordered our appetizer and food."
386,03d4VUFWlAR7PssD_fbLdg,3,"After I got my margarita, it went a little downhill...."
386,03d4VUFWlAR7PssD_fbLdg,3,our server *izzy* wasn't very attentive to our table.
386,03d4VUFWlAR7PssD_fbLdg,3,She only asked how our food was at the very end of our dinner.
386,03d4VUFWlAR7PssD_fbLdg,3,I couldn't eat all of my shrimp because there was a very small amount of cocktail sauce (out server did not ask how they were either) She also passed our table MULTIPLE TIMES AND DID NOT ASK ME FOR ANOTHER MARGARITA OR MY PARTER ANOTHER SODA.
386,03d4VUFWlAR7PssD_fbLdg,3,"The food was good but honestly the server was a little under par, she's a good server but could put in a little more effort."
387,QgyVCMfIz4QpxkfP1lixiw,1,Worst service ever.
387,QgyVCMfIz4QpxkfP1lixiw,1,Food took almost 40 minutes despite almost nobody being there.
387,QgyVCMfIz4QpxkfP1lixiw,1,Watched 3 of the workers sit at the bar instead of actually working.
387,QgyVCMfIz4QpxkfP1lixiw,1,"Was excited to show my fiancé BurgerPalace as he had never been, talk about a let down."
387,QgyVCMfIz4QpxkfP1lixiw,1,Guess we won't be back.
387,QgyVCMfIz4QpxkfP1lixiw,1,"BurgerPalace use to be the place to be, but apparently they have gone downhill FAST..... :("
388,z35IKd9bX-iv9rflqEkjNw,1,Was a terrible experience!
388,z35IKd9bX-iv9rflqEkjNw,1,Started off with getting seated at a disgusting table.
388,z35IKd9bX-iv9rflqEkjNw,1,Once seated got terrible beer and terrible food.
388,z35IKd9bX-iv9rflqEkjNw,1,"Asked waitress why it was so bad compared to other BurgerPalace and all effect quote""this placed is fucked up"""
389,MzQsEq9b5d7852s9sogJVg,4,Great salad bar.
389,MzQsEq9b5d7852s9sogJVg,4,Fresh and well kept.
389,MzQsEq9b5d7852s9sogJVg,4, Friendly waitress.
389,MzQsEq9b5d7852s9sogJVg,4, The bathroom was nasty nasty.
389,MzQsEq9b5d7852s9sogJVg,4, And Such a turn off at any restaurant.
389,MzQsEq9b5d7852s9sogJVg,4, If I had visited the bathroom before I ate.. probably couldn't have eaten.
389,MzQsEq9b5d7852s9sogJVg,4, It was early afternoon   Around 1pm
390,81qTRigjLzpSAtkf_2vOWA,1,Food is HORRIBLE & Over Priced!
390,81qTRigjLzpSAtkf_2vOWA,1,Only perks is the place is clean and good servers.
390,81qTRigjLzpSAtkf_2vOWA,1,But after getting bad food several times and having to have it removed from my ticket it was so bad I never went back.
390,81qTRigjLzpSAtkf_2vOWA,1,Drinks are over priced .
390,81qTRigjLzpSAtkf_2vOWA,1,How do you ruin a cheeseburger!?
391,TrERoQFbFQJsyB2XFikqKg,4,The salad bar was excellent and so were the coconut shrimp appetizers.
391,TrERoQFbFQJsyB2XFikqKg,4,They were 4ppl in our party 3 got the bar and shrimp one got hamburger and loaded potato and said hers was delicious!
391,TrERoQFbFQJsyB2XFikqKg,4,Susan did a wonderful job as our server!
391,TrERoQFbFQJsyB2XFikqKg,4,Definitely going back!!!
392,An_e0Tk7kYmtd-dtytCRZg,3,Only go here for the salad bar and ribs.
392,An_e0Tk7kYmtd-dtytCRZg,3,"Unfortunately, Service can be hit or miss."
392,An_e0Tk7kYmtd-dtytCRZg,3,Decent drink menu.
393,Z7umlYQaj1fyYwNMxUTvEA,1,RTI is a ghost kitchen for other companies.
393,Z7umlYQaj1fyYwNMxUTvEA,1,We ordered three Beast Burgers and every single one of them were wrong.
393,Z7umlYQaj1fyYwNMxUTvEA,1,"The seasoned fries should be renamed ""a cup of seasoning with some fries tossed in it"".  Will not order again from Mr Beast or RTI."
393,Z7umlYQaj1fyYwNMxUTvEA,1, Very sad experience.
394,KrJHA8A7Gz53bj91hHRw6g,4,Pretty good today!
394,KrJHA8A7Gz53bj91hHRw6g,4,The waitress and hostess were both super sweet and interacted with my 2 year old playfully which I appreciated.
394,KrJHA8A7Gz53bj91hHRw6g,4,"The food was good, however, my steak was well done rather than the medium well I asked for but I still ate it so it was pretty good."
394,KrJHA8A7Gz53bj91hHRw6g,4,The loaded potato was AMAZING!
395,vNppSFFh6dG-nzO3P3ARmA,3,"Ordered through door dash last night, 3/3/2022.I got the chicken and broccoli pasta Alfredo."
395,vNppSFFh6dG-nzO3P3ARmA,3,"This BurgerPalace has another name listed for the restaurant that I ordered from, Pasta Americana."
395,vNppSFFh6dG-nzO3P3ARmA,3,The food came and it looked as expected.
395,vNppSFFh6dG-nzO3P3ARmA,3,I also ordered two shrimp skewers for my daughter.
395,vNppSFFh6dG-nzO3P3ARmA,3,"When I ate the pasta, it literally had no flavor."
395,vNppSFFh6dG-nzO3P3ARmA,3,And it was $18.
395,vNppSFFh6dG-nzO3P3ARmA,3,Why...
395,vNppSFFh6dG-nzO3P3ARmA,3,I have no idea.
395,vNppSFFh6dG-nzO3P3ARmA,3,"The shrimp did not come on skewers, it just came into two plastic clamshell containers."
395,vNppSFFh6dG-nzO3P3ARmA,3,Which that didn't matter to me.
395,vNppSFFh6dG-nzO3P3ARmA,3,But there were 4 in each clamshell (2 separate ones for some reason)...I think it was like $6 for the 8 shrimp.
395,vNppSFFh6dG-nzO3P3ARmA,3,The pasta just had no taste.
395,vNppSFFh6dG-nzO3P3ARmA,3,I had to add more cheese and salt to taste anything.
395,vNppSFFh6dG-nzO3P3ARmA,3,"I doubt I will return, this restaurant has not been good for years now and I gave it another chance but that's probably the last visit for me."
396,jj_vCFarJz-t_fZAH23A4Q,1,"Piss poor ass GM piss poor ass service just awful,"
396,jj_vCFarJz-t_fZAH23A4Q,1,"I use to come all the time to this wonderful dated restaurant because of the servers, Susan, Natasha, Joshua, Wendy the manager."
396,jj_vCFarJz-t_fZAH23A4Q,1,I even continued to come when there was no A/C last yr.
396,jj_vCFarJz-t_fZAH23A4Q,1,I even came when they were open during the pandemic.
396,jj_vCFarJz-t_fZAH23A4Q,1,"Now I come back because I feel safe to be around other people, and everything has gone to shyt."
396,jj_vCFarJz-t_fZAH23A4Q,1,"The burger I had was over cooked n dry, the fries were mostly burnt and the desserts taste different."
396,jj_vCFarJz-t_fZAH23A4Q,1,I wasted $112 and the sever didn't even ask if I was unhappy with all my picked over food.
396,jj_vCFarJz-t_fZAH23A4Q,1,"I paid, tipped and will never ever return again."
397,S77mnV_avwFiTpYwMbvrYQ,1,I took my grandchildren here to have dinner....biggest mistake ever but this is the one place they wanted to eat after living in London for the last 2 years....
397,S77mnV_avwFiTpYwMbvrYQ,1,there were maybe 5 tables in the entire building with customers and we waited almost 45 minutes for our food as I watched it sit in the window getting cold for at least 15 minutes before pointing it out to the waitress who brought it over....yes it was cold and uneatable
397,S77mnV_avwFiTpYwMbvrYQ,1,....the waitress not 1 time checked on our table and the manager was too busy sitting at the bar having a drink and I had to gesture for him to come over and as I told him the issue he just looked at me and asked if I was ready to pay my check....
397,S77mnV_avwFiTpYwMbvrYQ,1,I did not eat anything after the 1st bite nor did my grandchildren....not even an apology but he didn't mind swiping my card for $57....
397,S77mnV_avwFiTpYwMbvrYQ,1,take your business elsewhere....
397,S77mnV_avwFiTpYwMbvrYQ,1,we opted for McDonald s and got better service than at this so called restaurant
398,Sp5bsYLPdJMQeCDs-6v_0w,2,Went there tonight with the family.
398,Sp5bsYLPdJMQeCDs-6v_0w,2,What a mistake.
398,Sp5bsYLPdJMQeCDs-6v_0w,2,Wife did the all you can eat salad.
398,Sp5bsYLPdJMQeCDs-6v_0w,2,She only got 1 small plate of salad minus some of the items she requested.
398,Sp5bsYLPdJMQeCDs-6v_0w,2,Never was asked if she wanted more.
398,Sp5bsYLPdJMQeCDs-6v_0w,2, If you can't have a normal salad bar just shut it down.
398,Sp5bsYLPdJMQeCDs-6v_0w,2,The servers can't follow the sheet you fill out for your salad so please just stop.
398,Sp5bsYLPdJMQeCDs-6v_0w,2, The steaks we ordered eh.   My son and I asked for medium Steaks his was perfect mine was a hockey puck.
398,Sp5bsYLPdJMQeCDs-6v_0w,2,I dealt with it since the cooks clearly haven't been trained.
398,Sp5bsYLPdJMQeCDs-6v_0w,2,Over all the experience here tonight helped us make the decision to always go to Long Horns.
398,Sp5bsYLPdJMQeCDs-6v_0w,2, I should of disputed my cc charges but instead I'll warn others to keep far away from here.
398,Sp5bsYLPdJMQeCDs-6v_0w,2, 
398,Sp5bsYLPdJMQeCDs-6v_0w,2,SMH
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,A little background first on this place.
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,I saw this place on Grubhub which was listed as The Captain's Boil.
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,I was wondering why it wasn't on Yelp until I tried to add the business and BurgerPalace popped up.
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,"The same location as well as phone number, I decided to call the place to find out who they actually were."
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,They then told me they were BurgerPalace but also cooked for the Captain's Boil.
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,My order through GrubHub:
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,I saw nothing but seafood on this page and decided to give them a go through GrubHub.
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,I ordered crab legs for 2 and plus the crawfish.
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,I was feenin for some seafood and thought I would give them a whirl.
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,Baddest and most expensive experience I've ever had in my life!!Crablegs:
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,The crab legs for one comes with 2 clusters and 5 legs on each from what I was told.
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,"So ordering for 2, I figured I had 4 clusters plus the corn and potatoes as well as the crawfish also with corn and potatoes."
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,No dice!!I got ripped off bad on the crab legs.
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,I had 2 clusters with the legs and they put in just the two bodies with no legs at all!
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,I was so pissed!!
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,Crawfish:
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,"As this is crawfish season, how in the world did I end up with the tiniest crawfish imaginable!"
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,"There was not one decent size crawfish in my order at all, and I may have gotten only 10, and that's being generous."
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,I probably got less than that.
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,Captain Boils sauce:
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,Are you kidding me??
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,Really??
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,This so called sauce was nothing more than messy at best.
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,"It didn't bring out anything to me particularly in the seafood at all, well for the little seafood I did have."
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,That was a total waste!!Corn on the cob:
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,That tasted pretty good.
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,Nice sweet corn with somewhat of a little kick is always favorable to me.
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,I did have 3 of those which I think I should have 4-5 because I had 2 orders of the crab legs and 1 crawfish which also comes with it.
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,"Again, ANOTHER EPIC FAIL!!Potatoes:"
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,That was a total joke as I was supposed to get 3 but they served them quartered up.
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,I may have had 6 pieces of potatoes out of the whole thing!!
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,Price:
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,This whole total EPIC FAIL cost me $66.00 including the tip for my GrubHub driver.
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,I have NEVER in my life had such disgusting piss poor service from a so-called seafood restaurant!
399,VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,!
400,OQjNpHhoasRE77op9foAjQ,4,We have bypassed this restaurant for two year since moving to Winder.
400,OQjNpHhoasRE77op9foAjQ,4,We decided to try it when friends suggested it for dinner.
400,OQjNpHhoasRE77op9foAjQ,4,We have been three times now.
400,OQjNpHhoasRE77op9foAjQ,4,We have not been disappointed in the food or the service.
400,OQjNpHhoasRE77op9foAjQ,4,"We have tried burgers, chicken dinners and several appetizers."
400,OQjNpHhoasRE77op9foAjQ,4, Everything was yummy.
400,OQjNpHhoasRE77op9foAjQ,4,The salad bar was fresh and well stocked with great variety.
401,EOWeFBoKCU_4YtR5YQo-wg,1,"Tatortots were good, but that's about it."
401,EOWeFBoKCU_4YtR5YQo-wg,1,Salad bar needed refilling and the lettuce was brown.
401,EOWeFBoKCU_4YtR5YQo-wg,1,$11.99 for all you can eat.
401,EOWeFBoKCU_4YtR5YQo-wg,1,I had to work to make one!
401,EOWeFBoKCU_4YtR5YQo-wg,1,No tea refills offered and men's restroom was nasty.
401,EOWeFBoKCU_4YtR5YQo-wg,1,Don't waste your money
402,bqu08vaIpE2BQkOzIRkOkQ,1,This place sucked.
402,bqu08vaIpE2BQkOzIRkOkQ,1,"Our waitress was nice at first (keep in mind it was only a table of 4) we ordered food and drinks, our drinks came pretty quickly which was nice but while waiting for our food which took over an hour we never got refills, she came over to our table with someone else's food and told us the chef made the wrong thing."
402,bqu08vaIpE2BQkOzIRkOkQ,1,We had been waiting for awhile and were all practically starving and tired.
402,bqu08vaIpE2BQkOzIRkOkQ,1,She walked past us again and just threw trash on the floor right beside us.
402,bqu08vaIpE2BQkOzIRkOkQ,1,The men's bathroom was even worse it was trashed and dirty.
402,bqu08vaIpE2BQkOzIRkOkQ,1,"After more than an hour we got some of our food the fries were cold, the pasta was cold and  practically uncooked we immediately got up and paid for our drinks (keep in mind only 3 out of 4 os us got the food) the manager said that the food was cold because when the chef made the food wrong she didn't want to take the food out and have someone waiting."
402,bqu08vaIpE2BQkOzIRkOkQ,1,Even though one of us never even got our food.
402,bqu08vaIpE2BQkOzIRkOkQ,1,This place was a total letdown and a mistake not to mention the fact the pasta made one of us sick.
402,bqu08vaIpE2BQkOzIRkOkQ,1,If I could put 0 stars I would.
403,zcP8-GAt_Hk_2tTjTU4khA,1,"Mt Vernon Ohio has one ""steak house"", mainly only due  to the liquor license in the city."
403,zcP8-GAt_Hk_2tTjTU4khA,1, 
403,zcP8-GAt_Hk_2tTjTU4khA,1,The  restaurant is very old and dingy.
403,zcP8-GAt_Hk_2tTjTU4khA,1,They are sitting on a gold mine but refuse to update.
403,zcP8-GAt_Hk_2tTjTU4khA,1, The salad bar on TV looks so good...we go in every time they advertise the additional items...never changes and any mention of it falls on deaf ears.
403,zcP8-GAt_Hk_2tTjTU4khA,1,"If you don't want to update and improve, it's time to move on and let another restaurant come in and appreciate the community."
403,zcP8-GAt_Hk_2tTjTU4khA,1,We are going to try it one last time today (we always say that).
403,zcP8-GAt_Hk_2tTjTU4khA,1, 
403,zcP8-GAt_Hk_2tTjTU4khA,1,If the salad bar is not changed again we are done.**Update!Went to lunch there today and.....the salad bar was updated and GREAT!
403,zcP8-GAt_Hk_2tTjTU4khA,1,  
403,zcP8-GAt_Hk_2tTjTU4khA,1,So happy after several years of asking them for a good salad bar it has finally happened.
404,a0s0AEVegTxy_6u661frdA,1,"I haven't been here in a while, tried to place a pick up order and nobody would answer the phone."
404,a0s0AEVegTxy_6u661frdA,1,"So I went in to do it, waited at the bar for a menu."
404,a0s0AEVegTxy_6u661frdA,1,"The bartender kept putting me off ( nobody at the bar mind you), wouldn't give me a menu and was telling other customers she was sick of all these ""bag people"" lol referring to the take-outs."
404,a0s0AEVegTxy_6u661frdA,1,"I totally understand her frustration, there is a REAL shortage of employees available to work right now."
404,a0s0AEVegTxy_6u661frdA,1,"This is clearly a management issue, it seemed the bartender had probably 4 or 5 tops and also cashiering the in restaurant customers."
404,a0s0AEVegTxy_6u661frdA,1,Hopefully things aren't as bad there as it seems.
405,DU69XSMLippbRCNb8VTnNA,4,"The food was good, warm and ready when I arrived to the restaurant for pickup."
405,DU69XSMLippbRCNb8VTnNA,4,"The App didn't work well, so I had to call the order into the restaurant."
406,U4AfyPXgQ3aA7DqTBva1VQ,1,I can't find anything less then zero on my ratings chart.
406,U4AfyPXgQ3aA7DqTBva1VQ,1,We visited Saturday afternoon.
406,U4AfyPXgQ3aA7DqTBva1VQ,1,We used to come here quite often.
406,U4AfyPXgQ3aA7DqTBva1VQ,1,This visit was terrible!!
406,U4AfyPXgQ3aA7DqTBva1VQ,1,We waited forever to be seated.
406,U4AfyPXgQ3aA7DqTBva1VQ,1,The salad bar was a disaster.
406,U4AfyPXgQ3aA7DqTBva1VQ,1,There was nothing on the bar.
406,U4AfyPXgQ3aA7DqTBva1VQ,1,I could have scraped more salad off the floor then there was on the bar.
406,U4AfyPXgQ3aA7DqTBva1VQ,1,The burger I had was terrible   This is last visit to BurgerPalace TERRIBLE TERRIBLE!!!
407,nT2PQx9GeBB9wiDCNhYqyg,1,Nope!
407,nT2PQx9GeBB9wiDCNhYqyg,1,Don't do it!
407,nT2PQx9GeBB9wiDCNhYqyg,1,You will regret it!
407,nT2PQx9GeBB9wiDCNhYqyg,1,Terrible service.
407,nT2PQx9GeBB9wiDCNhYqyg,1,The salad bar was soooo gross and frozen and the burger was under cooked even though they asked how I wanted it.
408,7Nz6QVaL2dntzZ2jMv_3WA,2,I was so impressed that I won't be returning anytime soon.
408,7Nz6QVaL2dntzZ2jMv_3WA,2,The place wasn't busy but it took quite a while to receive our food.
408,7Nz6QVaL2dntzZ2jMv_3WA,2,I ordered the tomato soup.
408,7Nz6QVaL2dntzZ2jMv_3WA,2,There was way too much cheese on the top.
408,7Nz6QVaL2dntzZ2jMv_3WA,2,Two heaping spoonfuls.
408,7Nz6QVaL2dntzZ2jMv_3WA,2,"I like cheese, but not when it kills the flavor of the soup."
408,7Nz6QVaL2dntzZ2jMv_3WA,2,Two people in our party ordered burgers medium.
408,7Nz6QVaL2dntzZ2jMv_3WA,2,The burgers looked more medium rare.
408,7Nz6QVaL2dntzZ2jMv_3WA,2,Way too much pink.
408,7Nz6QVaL2dntzZ2jMv_3WA,2,Service was lackluster.
408,7Nz6QVaL2dntzZ2jMv_3WA,2,"On another note, they do have their salad bar available."
408,7Nz6QVaL2dntzZ2jMv_3WA,2,Not sure the Covid regulations with that.
409,BSFw6heSgNn5qr6OcMwrZg,2,Just got charge SIX DOLLARS for 8 ounces of soup.
409,BSFw6heSgNn5qr6OcMwrZg,2,And by the way it was disgusting.
409,BSFw6heSgNn5qr6OcMwrZg,2,I called the manager and she said this was not a mistake.
409,BSFw6heSgNn5qr6OcMwrZg,2,That this is the right size for $6.
409,BSFw6heSgNn5qr6OcMwrZg,2,Ridiculous.
409,BSFw6heSgNn5qr6OcMwrZg,2,Especially for pre-made soup in a bag that they added frozen broccoli to.
410,Z6fUbRrxogSAZ9GbPNfphg,5,"The food and beverages are always on point, and they are providing a dining option in these unusual times."
410,Z6fUbRrxogSAZ9GbPNfphg,5, 
410,Z6fUbRrxogSAZ9GbPNfphg,5,Thanks to all who work there.
411,ahohjoWqOaSJuyi-mUHLqA,2,"Very dated and dirty, slow service."
411,ahohjoWqOaSJuyi-mUHLqA,2,Great Salad bar!
411,ahohjoWqOaSJuyi-mUHLqA,2, The best part of this experience was I got to be with my Mom on my Birthday and I only paid $2.00 for my meal.
412,NZl2HeWQvvySXPwk3IPypQ,1,SLOW service at best.
412,NZl2HeWQvvySXPwk3IPypQ,1,Waited for 5 minutes to see a hostess then after placing drink orders it was another 15 before we asked if they were coming.
412,NZl2HeWQvvySXPwk3IPypQ,1, 
412,NZl2HeWQvvySXPwk3IPypQ,1,"Had to ""fetch"" my own silverware."
412,NZl2HeWQvvySXPwk3IPypQ,1,Party of 5 seated in a booth #cramped.
412,NZl2HeWQvvySXPwk3IPypQ,1,The heater is not working and instead of using the back of the house they seat people by the door.
412,NZl2HeWQvvySXPwk3IPypQ,1,Awful
413,ezqppMkH5FxpVYke3fQbSg,4,Went in today..
413,ezqppMkH5FxpVYke3fQbSg,4,place looked empty w ppl waiting for seating.
413,ezqppMkH5FxpVYke3fQbSg,4,Opted to sit at bar after host said they were Shor staffed.
413,ezqppMkH5FxpVYke3fQbSg,4,Also told us that the last time we went..
413,ezqppMkH5FxpVYke3fQbSg,4,bartender Tiffany acknowledged us and was pleasant.
413,ezqppMkH5FxpVYke3fQbSg,4,She also had tables in the bar.
413,ezqppMkH5FxpVYke3fQbSg,4,We got our beers.
413,ezqppMkH5FxpVYke3fQbSg,4,Had salad and an app.
413,ezqppMkH5FxpVYke3fQbSg,4, Still not seating alot of ppl.
413,ezqppMkH5FxpVYke3fQbSg,4,App was out in.
413,ezqppMkH5FxpVYke3fQbSg,4,Tmely meter.
413,ezqppMkH5FxpVYke3fQbSg,4,So glad to see the salad bR back.
413,ezqppMkH5FxpVYke3fQbSg,4,Was delicious as I remember.
413,ezqppMkH5FxpVYke3fQbSg,4,I think the staff was doing the best they could under the circumstances.
413,ezqppMkH5FxpVYke3fQbSg,4,Tiffany was great
414,KWsBfcIIj6j9qNI-MYC62w,3,So my wife and I normally frequent RT and due to COVID Delta variant we still do the take-out option.
414,KWsBfcIIj6j9qNI-MYC62w,3, The takeout service is good overall even if it was a little behind yesterday.  
414,KWsBfcIIj6j9qNI-MYC62w,3,"I normally get a burger or a main dish which is always good, but yesterday I opt'd to get the brisket sandwich because I was looking for something a bit different."
414,KWsBfcIIj6j9qNI-MYC62w,3,"  I don't know what was more disappointing; the brisket sandwich which was nothing more than 3 very overcooked pieces of meat that were NOT brisket, or the 5-6 onion rings that came with it."
414,KWsBfcIIj6j9qNI-MYC62w,3, You can't simply throw some sauce on meat and call it barbecue...
414,KWsBfcIIj6j9qNI-MYC62w,3,RT needs to stick with their burgers because their idea of barbecue is well not cutting it.
414,KWsBfcIIj6j9qNI-MYC62w,3, I'll give it 3/5 because normally the food is good and hopefully the disappointing faux brisket was an isolated incident.
415,5IWIPE07bQx0ZzTwSlUylA,1,We were seated but we sat and no one came.
415,5IWIPE07bQx0ZzTwSlUylA,1,Not even to ask us what we wanted to drink.
415,5IWIPE07bQx0ZzTwSlUylA,1,"So we continued to wait, decided on food."
415,5IWIPE07bQx0ZzTwSlUylA,1,Still no one came.
415,5IWIPE07bQx0ZzTwSlUylA,1,You know it's been a while if you know what you want and you haven't seen a waitress even just for drinks.
415,5IWIPE07bQx0ZzTwSlUylA,1, 
415,5IWIPE07bQx0ZzTwSlUylA,1,Sheesh.
415,5IWIPE07bQx0ZzTwSlUylA,1,"Plus the floors were sticky and greasy, felt gross under our shoes."
415,5IWIPE07bQx0ZzTwSlUylA,1,So we left.
415,5IWIPE07bQx0ZzTwSlUylA,1,Disappointing.
416,i7CabidXj92dIGypdQeJFQ,1,Terrible.
416,i7CabidXj92dIGypdQeJFQ,1,We came in with our two kids and were very displeased.
416,i7CabidXj92dIGypdQeJFQ,1,It took almost a half hour to even have our drink order taken..
416,i7CabidXj92dIGypdQeJFQ,1,"We ordered our daughters food, which was fine, but we ordered ourselves the ribeye with grilled shrimp, one meal with onion rings and macaroni and cheese & the other meal with loaded tots and macaroni and cheese."
416,i7CabidXj92dIGypdQeJFQ,1,First meal we are served are two plates of ribs.
416,i7CabidXj92dIGypdQeJFQ,1,"This was obviously wrong, so I told the waitress it was wrong."
416,i7CabidXj92dIGypdQeJFQ,1,"She said she must've misheard us, but she asked us how we wanted our steaks cooked when she took our order."
416,i7CabidXj92dIGypdQeJFQ,1,"It then took almost an hour to get our food fixed, and even then it was still wrong."
416,i7CabidXj92dIGypdQeJFQ,1,"We were served two steaks, one of which came with shrimp, with a baked potato, onion rings, tots and macaroni and cheese.. not the sides we ordered."
416,i7CabidXj92dIGypdQeJFQ,1,Terrible time here unfortunately.
417,fNxLyuWFO0OYAUqfyd80oQ,1,"Ordered take out waited almost an hour longer than quoted, no big deal, I love standing around in a mask."
417,fNxLyuWFO0OYAUqfyd80oQ,1," Got home and did not recieve my appetizers, partially my fault; I should have checked at the restaurant....just wanted to get home and eat at that point."
417,fNxLyuWFO0OYAUqfyd80oQ,1,"So I called and they were aware I did not receive all the food I ordered and said I could come pick it up, I live about 15 minutes away (1/2 hour round trip) so I just wanted a refund....nope apparently ruby tuesday  does not have a way to refund a customer."
417,fNxLyuWFO0OYAUqfyd80oQ,1,What a joke....can't refund a customer?
417,fNxLyuWFO0OYAUqfyd80oQ,1,"They did, however, offer to pay for a future meal, I declined how would that even work?"
417,fNxLyuWFO0OYAUqfyd80oQ,1,Guess they have to upkeep those Tesla chargers somehow.
418,apoLeOZQ6TiRle8wmEHcNg,2,Pretty disappointed in our experience tonight.
418,apoLeOZQ6TiRle8wmEHcNg,2,Our food was delicious but I was so disappointed with my steak tonight.
418,apoLeOZQ6TiRle8wmEHcNg,2,The manager didn't care when it was brought to his attention.
418,apoLeOZQ6TiRle8wmEHcNg,2,Easily 50% straight gristle.
418,apoLeOZQ6TiRle8wmEHcNg,2,See the picture below.
419,eLoXSU4Rzgkmq1ndKiisEA,1,Went here a couple days ago- my husband and I haven't been here in years and thought why not let's go.
419,eLoXSU4Rzgkmq1ndKiisEA,1,We get there and it was like 2:30 on a weekday so not too busy maybe 4 other tables if that.
419,eLoXSU4Rzgkmq1ndKiisEA,1,"While ordering I ordered what I wanted, my husband tried to order what he wanted which included coleslaw, the waitress proceeded to tell him not to order it and how gross it was there.. ordered something else."
419,eLoXSU4Rzgkmq1ndKiisEA,1,"I ordered a salad with mine which usually comes out first, all we got was our drinks after about 5 minutes and then she brought out salads and COLESLAW for the couple that came in after we ordered our drinks."
419,eLoXSU4Rzgkmq1ndKiisEA,1,My husband and I just looked at each other and I asked the waitress if we could pay for our drinks and go.
419,eLoXSU4Rzgkmq1ndKiisEA,1,She said we could just go and that she was sorry but I'm just very confused about what happened there lol.
419,eLoXSU4Rzgkmq1ndKiisEA,1,Definitely won't be back.
420,HWhQsMRXNPeXC0rKc_4L3w,4,Our waitress was very dry and attentive.
420,HWhQsMRXNPeXC0rKc_4L3w,4,Service was quick.
420,HWhQsMRXNPeXC0rKc_4L3w,4,Food was good and hot.
420,HWhQsMRXNPeXC0rKc_4L3w,4,Salad bar was clean and stocked.
420,HWhQsMRXNPeXC0rKc_4L3w,4,My only complaint is my husband wanted the coconut shrimp platter which they were all out of.
420,HWhQsMRXNPeXC0rKc_4L3w,4,Other then that it was a pleasant experience.
420,HWhQsMRXNPeXC0rKc_4L3w,4,Would recommend and will return in the future.
421,_kyn5mhaHbaYZohrEPUAAw,4,The family decided we were going to BurgerPalace for dinner yesterday.
421,_kyn5mhaHbaYZohrEPUAAw,4,Got there around 5pm.
421,_kyn5mhaHbaYZohrEPUAAw,4,There were a good amount of cars in the parking lot.
421,_kyn5mhaHbaYZohrEPUAAw,4,Hostess sat us right way.
421,_kyn5mhaHbaYZohrEPUAAw,4,Waitress took our drink orders and food orders when we were ready.
421,_kyn5mhaHbaYZohrEPUAAw,4,I didn't see a name tag but she was very good and very efficient.
421,_kyn5mhaHbaYZohrEPUAAw,4,All our food came out at the same time and was hot and delicious.
421,_kyn5mhaHbaYZohrEPUAAw,4,Not one complaint from any of us.
421,_kyn5mhaHbaYZohrEPUAAw,4, Will definitely be back
422,KnNABItqtp5BjKQNOM6qkA,1,I would like to leave a review for this restaurant.
422,KnNABItqtp5BjKQNOM6qkA,1,"However, it's difficult because we stood in the lobby over five minutes and there wasn't a single person in there available to help seat us."
422,KnNABItqtp5BjKQNOM6qkA,1,We walked out.
423,5tELbXWl6h2q2WlYTXHSEA,4,"So as far as the food goes very average typical BurgerPalace much like Fridays, Applebees etc...."
423,5tELbXWl6h2q2WlYTXHSEA,4,With that said we had a great server.
423,5tELbXWl6h2q2WlYTXHSEA,4,"A nice very nice young man, very polite and full of charm."
423,5tELbXWl6h2q2WlYTXHSEA,4,Great personality.
423,5tELbXWl6h2q2WlYTXHSEA,4,I attached a copy of the check to help identify him.
423,5tELbXWl6h2q2WlYTXHSEA,4,I think his name was Taj.
424,589b1ruowZaXzuHXqD2h4w,2,Our server was working hard.
424,589b1ruowZaXzuHXqD2h4w,2,They appeared short staffed.
424,589b1ruowZaXzuHXqD2h4w,2,My daughter ordered a steak medium rare.
424,589b1ruowZaXzuHXqD2h4w,2,It arrived well done.
424,589b1ruowZaXzuHXqD2h4w,2,She had ordered fries as her side.
424,589b1ruowZaXzuHXqD2h4w,2,The fries did not arrive with her meal.
424,589b1ruowZaXzuHXqD2h4w,2,We were told it would be a few minutes.
424,589b1ruowZaXzuHXqD2h4w,2,I watched five other orders arrive with fries.
424,589b1ruowZaXzuHXqD2h4w,2,Still no fries for us.
424,589b1ruowZaXzuHXqD2h4w,2,The fries arrived twenty minutes later after she finished the rest of her meal.
424,589b1ruowZaXzuHXqD2h4w,2,I had ordered the endless soup.
424,589b1ruowZaXzuHXqD2h4w,2,When I tried to order a second bowl the waitress said she didn't know how long it would take.
424,589b1ruowZaXzuHXqD2h4w,2,Waited 15 minutes and it had still nor arrived.
424,589b1ruowZaXzuHXqD2h4w,2,The manager did comp one of our meals but it was a frustrating dinner.
425,ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,Came here with a friend the other day.
425,ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,"Parking was easy, and the restaurant was easy to find."
425,ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,"Got seated pretty quickly, but ended up waiting a while for our food, especially considering the restaurant was essentially empty"
425,ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,.
425,ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,"I got the salad bar, and my friend got the crispy chicken sandwich with fries (which shouldn't have taken that long to cook)."
425,ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,"The interior was nicer than expected, definitely a nice ambiance for a date night."
425,ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,"My friend said that the chicken came out piping hot, and she could tell it was freshly cooked."
425,ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,She said the chicken was beautifully crispy and had the perfect crunch on the outside.
425,ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,She said the fries were average and didn't thrill her.
425,ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,"She's had better, but she's also had worse."
425,ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,I enjoyed the salad bar.
425,ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,They had gloves available to wear before touching the utensils for infection control.
425,ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,The ingredients appeared to be fresh and didn't seem to be sitting out for too long.
425,ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,"It had salad ingredients, along with coleslaw (utterly disgusting), broccoli salad (delicious), and watermelon slices."
425,ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,"The only proteins available were diced egg and a slimy diced ham, which was disappointing."
425,ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,There were a variety of dressings available.
425,ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,Prices on the menu appeared to be average.
425,ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,"Overall, there wasn't anything spectacular that would draw me back again, but nothing adverse happened that would keep me from eating here again."
425,ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,I had an average experience at BurgerPalace
426,LX3bKUG5kvae0irGgRJplQ,5,"I had the Chicken Fresco which was delicious, the light sauce it was in was perfect."
426,LX3bKUG5kvae0irGgRJplQ,5,"It came with 2 sides, I picked the dirty rice and steamed broccoli, both were  excellent."
426,LX3bKUG5kvae0irGgRJplQ,5,The steamed broccoli was probably the best I ever had.
426,LX3bKUG5kvae0irGgRJplQ,5,"My waitress, Kerri, was nice and never did I have to ask for a refill of my water, she was on top of it."
426,LX3bKUG5kvae0irGgRJplQ,5,Highly recommend!
427,IDoCLvCho_KrHFWYx3Hr8g,4,"Came here with friends late for dinner I ordered a cheeseburger and the salad bar both were very delicious, our waitress did a fantastic job."
428,jZ6b025Y7PPxQ3EgC-Fy5A,1,"Bartender is trying, but it is a rough scenario."
428,jZ6b025Y7PPxQ3EgC-Fy5A,1,"Pure chaos start to finish, needs a 911 cooking show to help asap."
429,1ZXHyakSyssTvAdvmTy5Aw,3,Great service except I ordered a ribeye and got a pork chop.
429,1ZXHyakSyssTvAdvmTy5Aw,3,They wanted to argue with me.
429,1ZXHyakSyssTvAdvmTy5Aw,3,Last time I checked beef isn't white lol
430,aF68pT4CqJS3bV9H_aNb4g,1,"Got seated by the host, who was very grumpy and lowkey threw the silverware down aggressively."
430,aF68pT4CqJS3bV9H_aNb4g,1,"No one greeted us, not one staff member acknowledged us."
430,aF68pT4CqJS3bV9H_aNb4g,1,"After twenty minutes of sitting ignored, we got up and left."
430,aF68pT4CqJS3bV9H_aNb4g,1,This location is giving purgatory lol
431,SSQkMFPCaETSkJD2vFgWag,1,When we travel a BurgerPalace T is a reliable chain you know what your getting.
431,SSQkMFPCaETSkJD2vFgWag,1,In my years going to BurgerPalace T this was beyond disapointing.
431,SSQkMFPCaETSkJD2vFgWag,1,"The burger my wife after i finished 2nd round of salid bar and wife told they didnt start her burger would she like somthing else,   her order was bacon  cheese burger well  no pink and tater tots."
431,SSQkMFPCaETSkJD2vFgWag,1, In 32 years of marriage I have never known her to order any meat that hasn't been cremated.
431,SSQkMFPCaETSkJD2vFgWag,1,When her order finally showed up no tater tots regular French fries and when she cut in to the  Burger it was rare short of mooing.
431,SSQkMFPCaETSkJD2vFgWag,1,The waiter told her that's how she ordered her Burger I about fell over in my seat.
431,SSQkMFPCaETSkJD2vFgWag,1,He told her that if he took the Burger and tater tots back it would be another another 15 min.
431,SSQkMFPCaETSkJD2vFgWag,1,The kitchen was busy .
431,SSQkMFPCaETSkJD2vFgWag,1,We asked for the check but was told  by another waiter  That he was busy trying to find someone to approve a discount on her Burger.
431,SSQkMFPCaETSkJD2vFgWag,1,So here's my message to the manager There was no discount and there'll be no return visit and we'll be sure to tell everybody what happened
432,OdOqdhgFNdWysxINY1uDwQ,2,Went to BurgerPalace this weekend because it was hot and I wanted a salad bar option.
432,OdOqdhgFNdWysxINY1uDwQ,2,The salad bar was very good!
432,OdOqdhgFNdWysxINY1uDwQ,2,"My wife ordered a steak which was also pretty good, so food wise, pretty good."
432,OdOqdhgFNdWysxINY1uDwQ,2,"Here is where my problem lies, I was in the Restaurant business for 16 years, I am a great tipper and I made my living that way for many years."
432,OdOqdhgFNdWysxINY1uDwQ,2,"At the end of the meal, I asked for the check and showed that I would be paying for the meal with a credit card."
432,OdOqdhgFNdWysxINY1uDwQ,2,"The server comes over and has a hand held devise which you put your card into, and they stand there holding it while you add the tip!!"
432,OdOqdhgFNdWysxINY1uDwQ,2,"What a horrible, horrible system, even being a good tipper I was shocked that this is how they handled card transaction."
432,OdOqdhgFNdWysxINY1uDwQ,2, 
432,OdOqdhgFNdWysxINY1uDwQ,2,"Knowing that Card tips are tracked, I usually tip cash, even when using a card."
432,OdOqdhgFNdWysxINY1uDwQ,2,"The server was visibly upset, and slammed our to go boxes on the table and walked away."
432,OdOqdhgFNdWysxINY1uDwQ,2,I am sure she felt better when returning to the table after we left.
432,OdOqdhgFNdWysxINY1uDwQ,2,"Please BurgerPalace rethink this process, don't put your customers and your employees in an uncomfortable position."
433,-5nhyuuBsoxmDkEJ3qsAow,1,Absolutely horrible I got a order out from here I ordered salmon and a burger the salmon I got with 2 sides and it was grilled zucchini and mashed potatoes I double checked my receipt and it CLEARLY shows what I ordered but what I got?
433,-5nhyuuBsoxmDkEJ3qsAow,1,A small salmon and 2 huge baked potatoes and they packaged it with 2 sour cream cups that had no lids it was spilled all over the food absolutely nasty I want a refund sadly I won't get one don't bother trying to eat here.
433,-5nhyuuBsoxmDkEJ3qsAow,1,Thumbs down x100
434,zlt47bKttOHvn96bgkK_9g,1,Called to double-check the hours and was told they were open until midnight.
434,zlt47bKttOHvn96bgkK_9g,1,"Drove well out of our way to go there, arriving about 20 min later, just after 10 pm only to be told they were closed."
434,zlt47bKttOHvn96bgkK_9g,1,The restaurant was busy so they weren't closing to lack of business.
434,zlt47bKttOHvn96bgkK_9g,1,"Very frustrating, wasting our time and gas to drive out there."
435,mwR3E1OuWhmucVzKbie9JA,3,"One of the few national chain sit down restaurants that we have locally, and it's sad that it's so hit or miss because people staying in the very very nearby 2 hotels probably gravitate to it as a national chain."
435,mwR3E1OuWhmucVzKbie9JA,3,"Their salad bar has been my go to place, but have not been purchasing salads out since the pandemic started, can't wait to get back to it."
435,mwR3E1OuWhmucVzKbie9JA,3,"Take out has been very very touchy, we always tip $1-$5 for takeout usually $3, but only a couple of times have we had Fabulous should be Expected Quality Service."
435,mwR3E1OuWhmucVzKbie9JA,3,"Sometimes they put you on hold and never come back for curbside, a couple of times they put you on hold and someone comes and hangs up the phone, they miss putting lids on sauces etc in your takeout and it spills everywhere defeets the purpose of sauce of the side to dip or just try, they fully forget items in the order, they tell you that you Have to come in for curbside, it seems to be the culture there to work little, other times the meal is packaged up Perfectly with condiments and lids and everything!,"
435,mwR3E1OuWhmucVzKbie9JA,3,"it's just unpredictable, but what Should a National Chain be, it Should be Predictable, you should be able to expect the same Every Visit!"
435,mwR3E1OuWhmucVzKbie9JA,3,"They don't know here that I won a 50th Anniversary prize on Instagram from BurgerPalace I should wear my attire there, huh, lol."
435,mwR3E1OuWhmucVzKbie9JA,3,"And even the marinara cups on the Crispy Mozzarella Sticks are inconsistent, some know to use the larger dipping cup, others use the small and you run out of sauce after 3 sticks, half the time it's been right and half the time wrong."
435,mwR3E1OuWhmucVzKbie9JA,3,"And the attitude that they give, putting you on hold and hanging up, etc."
435,mwR3E1OuWhmucVzKbie9JA,3,"Some of their new 50th Anniversary menu is pretty good, if you can get it made as it is meant to be---nice Philly Cheesesteak and Crispy Mozzarella sticks, don't know why I tried the Coconut Shrimp though, I don't like Coconut, lol, a no to those for me, lol, it was fresh coconut though, too strong for me, lol!"
435,mwR3E1OuWhmucVzKbie9JA,3,"And crazy dried out baked potato, must have been from 2 nights back, straight to the trash!"
435,mwR3E1OuWhmucVzKbie9JA,3,Other times the potatoes are Perfect!
435,mwR3E1OuWhmucVzKbie9JA,3,"We've been there in the past for big church celebrations and sometimes just carryout for 1, but they don't see that a $3 carryout tip one day could come back as $100 small group sitdown tip."
435,mwR3E1OuWhmucVzKbie9JA,3,"And all the email day by day specials they have, gosh I remember how good their steak was, might have to try the Sunday steak special."
435,mwR3E1OuWhmucVzKbie9JA,3,"We're always nice and never know what we're gonna get there, smh!"
436,LEvS9QUI-8uMfamoSH06fw,5,Great service and great food all around good experience  and we would love to go to BurgerPalace again really really soon.
436,LEvS9QUI-8uMfamoSH06fw,5,I really really extremely extremely extremely enjoyed the food prices and the service was spot on and the restaurant was clean there were no flies at all
437,i1IKReLctf9JPCh_6sE-tQ,5,Just had a great dinner.
437,i1IKReLctf9JPCh_6sE-tQ,5,I'm not really sure why the rating is low for this particular location.
437,i1IKReLctf9JPCh_6sE-tQ,5,We are new to Gloucester since purchasing a second home in June 2020.
437,i1IKReLctf9JPCh_6sE-tQ,5,We've been here several times for dinner and have not had a bad experience yet.
437,i1IKReLctf9JPCh_6sE-tQ,5,The service sticks out to me as always great.
437,i1IKReLctf9JPCh_6sE-tQ,5,"The staff is always upbeat, knowledgeable and efficient."
437,i1IKReLctf9JPCh_6sE-tQ,5,"The restaurant is up to date with COVID precautions, including proving fresh gloves for those who wish to use the salad bar."
437,i1IKReLctf9JPCh_6sE-tQ,5,I don't think I'd mind the gloves as a requirement once the pandemic ends.
437,i1IKReLctf9JPCh_6sE-tQ,5,I did not keep the receipt tonight or would have included the name of our server.
437,i1IKReLctf9JPCh_6sE-tQ,5,She was a blonde with short/med length hair.
437,i1IKReLctf9JPCh_6sE-tQ,5,We were greeted and seated promptly.
437,i1IKReLctf9JPCh_6sE-tQ,5,"As a server from many years ago, I've always considered myself a stickler for restaurant details."
438,Nedk9C24D8kA-fVAl5WKoQ,5,Love there food the best fries you will eat I promise      Our service was great I recommend Amanda
439,Y8KZNKvdgfRB8StjrXB6vg,1,On July 7th.
439,Y8KZNKvdgfRB8StjrXB6vg,1,Went to this BurgerPalace and felt very much disrespected.
439,Y8KZNKvdgfRB8StjrXB6vg,1,We went in for a to go salad and while we were still getting our salad they were changing the utensil.
439,Y8KZNKvdgfRB8StjrXB6vg,1,We wete the only ones there and being an African American I took it personal.
439,Y8KZNKvdgfRB8StjrXB6vg,1,"I guess to Corin, who is the general manager, we were more contaminated than others."
439,Y8KZNKvdgfRB8StjrXB6vg,1,Won't ever go back.
440,81BVFXDaYNSy_VX9is3W8A,4,Of course we come for the Garden Bar!
440,81BVFXDaYNSy_VX9is3W8A,4,"Whenever we're craving a good cold salad, this is where we go."
440,81BVFXDaYNSy_VX9is3W8A,4,We usually order seafood and ribs and our daughter likes the chicken tenders.
440,81BVFXDaYNSy_VX9is3W8A,4,"Sometimes the salad bar is not as well stocked as we would like and sometimes you don't see your server for awhile, but our experiences have never been bad enough to keep us from coming back."
441,9egA8FmH0FkA6acsPhtgtA,3,BurgerPalace has been that restaurant you always knew you gonna get a great meal.
441,9egA8FmH0FkA6acsPhtgtA,3,You can count on 1 hand how many people were dining in restaurant on a Friday night.
441,9egA8FmH0FkA6acsPhtgtA,3,That should of been my clue to go somewhere else.
441,9egA8FmH0FkA6acsPhtgtA,3,Ordered Hickory Salmon w/ side Mashed potatoes & broccoli.
441,9egA8FmH0FkA6acsPhtgtA,3,Looks good but the side portions are laughable.
441,9egA8FmH0FkA6acsPhtgtA,3,I knew it must be a kids meal.
441,9egA8FmH0FkA6acsPhtgtA,3,This cost $17.99 and these portions are so small.
441,9egA8FmH0FkA6acsPhtgtA,3,The shrimp fajitas taste great but the condiments are petite.
441,9egA8FmH0FkA6acsPhtgtA,3,Now I'm pissed of   I haven't been in years now I see why I have not been to BurgerPalaces.
442,dwJMJE1AeyQNEGqWG-UHBg,3,Foods taste was decent and service was good but within hour of eating everyone in our party had stomach pains and was rushing to the rest room with stuff coming from both ends.
442,dwJMJE1AeyQNEGqWG-UHBg,3,None of us had same food so idk what it was
443,exIoIUIqCzyfFYKLq4YooQ,5,"Being that farm fresh has left us on Military Hwy, BurgerPalace is the next best salad bar!!"
443,exIoIUIqCzyfFYKLq4YooQ,5,I literally only come here once a week for the salad bar which is always so fresh.
443,exIoIUIqCzyfFYKLq4YooQ,5,I know I can make a salad at home but I can't get the best croutons and balsamic vinaigrette in the world from the grocery store.
443,exIoIUIqCzyfFYKLq4YooQ,5,The woman at the bar is hands down the best.
443,exIoIUIqCzyfFYKLq4YooQ,5,She literally has 8 arms.
443,exIoIUIqCzyfFYKLq4YooQ,5,"She handles the bar, the phone, and takeouts."
444,4t_N7WJ8-rsd2wyepQN_Eg,1,Went to this establishment to get dinner with my family and the experience was extremely unpleasant.
444,4t_N7WJ8-rsd2wyepQN_Eg,1,I have a 1 year old & being that she was a little whiny (normal for a child that age!) a customer complained.
444,4t_N7WJ8-rsd2wyepQN_Eg,1,As a result of the complaint our waitress literally rushed us to leave.
444,4t_N7WJ8-rsd2wyepQN_Eg,1,"She brought our check out with our food, then she came back multiple times just to see if we were ready to pay and basically leave."
444,4t_N7WJ8-rsd2wyepQN_Eg,1,We didn't even get to enjoy dinner!
444,4t_N7WJ8-rsd2wyepQN_Eg,1,Very unprofessional.
444,4t_N7WJ8-rsd2wyepQN_Eg,1,"I called and complained and all the manager could say was ""aww, I'm so sorry. """
445,9KdJ7n8a2w52vQ-354jdKg,5,Food was great.
445,9KdJ7n8a2w52vQ-354jdKg,5,Good variety.
445,9KdJ7n8a2w52vQ-354jdKg,5,I had a steak while my wife had shrimp pasta.
445,9KdJ7n8a2w52vQ-354jdKg,5,We got chicken tenders for my toddler.
445,9KdJ7n8a2w52vQ-354jdKg,5,Good was ready quick too.
446,wuR6V0_xhoalNDtVQL6mpA,5,"Having driven 500+ miles and coming off an unfortunate hotel experience resulting in us cancelling our stay, separate review coming, we were tired, frustrated, and hungry, so we decided to stop here last minute."
446,wuR6V0_xhoalNDtVQL6mpA,5,Right when we walked in the hostess greeted us and she was exceptionally nice.
446,wuR6V0_xhoalNDtVQL6mpA,5,I mean nice to the point that we all but forgotten about our frustrating night.
446,wuR6V0_xhoalNDtVQL6mpA,5,I ordered all you can eat salad and the grilled salmon with rice and vegetables.
446,wuR6V0_xhoalNDtVQL6mpA,5,"While I don't go out of my way for run-of-the-mill American fare, I have to say my food absolutely hit the spot."
446,wuR6V0_xhoalNDtVQL6mpA,5,The rice salmon and veggies went so well and was just what I needed.
446,wuR6V0_xhoalNDtVQL6mpA,5,"I had the chocolate lava cake for dessert but since I had been on a diet cutting out added sugar, it was too sweet for my taste."
446,wuR6V0_xhoalNDtVQL6mpA,5,The star of the night however was our server.
446,wuR6V0_xhoalNDtVQL6mpA,5,She was a young lady only on her third day.
446,wuR6V0_xhoalNDtVQL6mpA,5,She was very nice and respectful and always asked us if we were okay or needed anything.
446,wuR6V0_xhoalNDtVQL6mpA,5,"Also, my friend who is also a waitress complimented her and was giving her some tips and she was very receptive to them."
446,wuR6V0_xhoalNDtVQL6mpA,5,"To summarize, while American chain is not on my radar, the food and especially the service, greatly improved our sour night."
446,wuR6V0_xhoalNDtVQL6mpA,5,If any place deserves 5 stars it is this one.
447,x6YkHaA_RqltSKllOxix2A,1,"Came to BurgerPalace on military hwy Norfork Virginia, with a party of 9 service horrible once I spoke about the wait on the food."
447,x6YkHaA_RqltSKllOxix2A,1,The waitress showed me her TRUE colors service was in the toilet there after.
447,x6YkHaA_RqltSKllOxix2A,1,"My sandwich was missing Bacon, informed the waitress she returned with Cold Bacon!!"
447,x6YkHaA_RqltSKllOxix2A,1,The manager act like this was the Normal here.
447,x6YkHaA_RqltSKllOxix2A,1,She took my sandwich of the bill and my son Shrimp that was Over Cook!!
447,x6YkHaA_RqltSKllOxix2A,1,The Day is 08/11/2021 arrive at 7pm and receive our Food at 8:25.
447,x6YkHaA_RqltSKllOxix2A,1,"I was told it was Rush Hour by our waitress, but people coming behind us receive their Food?"
447,x6YkHaA_RqltSKllOxix2A,1,I pick this place for my Son Graduation...........Man O Man.
448,aWB898mypdP0xB-5CM9q3Q,1,Disgusting!!!
448,aWB898mypdP0xB-5CM9q3Q,1,BurgerPalace needs to be closed.
448,aWB898mypdP0xB-5CM9q3Q,1,Hair was in my food.
448,aWB898mypdP0xB-5CM9q3Q,1,I got sick after eating.
448,aWB898mypdP0xB-5CM9q3Q,1, This place is the worst!!
448,aWB898mypdP0xB-5CM9q3Q,1,The restaurant was dirty and people not following rules to use gloves at salad bar.
448,aWB898mypdP0xB-5CM9q3Q,1,I would have given them no stars if I could.
448,aWB898mypdP0xB-5CM9q3Q,1,Ugh!!!!!
449,mbt_qnvSXPR0etENqlbWwA,2,This was the To-go chocolate lava cake and apple crumble skillet we ordered last night... it came with these three bites of ice cream and this is what the lava cake looked like when we opened the box.
449,mbt_qnvSXPR0etENqlbWwA,2,Both desserts tasted decent but it was definitely not worth $16 and we would not recommend.
450,6BP1y2FBETKgr7EDsCTcAA,5,I had a great experience here.
450,6BP1y2FBETKgr7EDsCTcAA,5,"Our waiter, Don was very attentive and kind."
450,6BP1y2FBETKgr7EDsCTcAA,5,The experience was wonderful.
450,6BP1y2FBETKgr7EDsCTcAA,5,The food was great and the customer service was the cherry on top.
451,lSM7GD8ohlI6U0Y0FFZl2g,2,Ordered a grilled chicken Caesar for pickup.
451,lSM7GD8ohlI6U0Y0FFZl2g,2,Received a crispy chicken ranch salad.. didn't really have time to have it corrected... hence the fact that I was ordering for pickup.
451,lSM7GD8ohlI6U0Y0FFZl2g,2,So much for a healthy-ish lunch.
452,arCnDyBsYtW9xt-5sphlBw,5,The ruby relaxer has a ton of ice.
452,arCnDyBsYtW9xt-5sphlBw,5,But the food was great.
452,arCnDyBsYtW9xt-5sphlBw,5,Got the trip with chicken ribs and shrimp.
452,arCnDyBsYtW9xt-5sphlBw,5,Tasted great.
453,Mgr0fRzYE68_XTnRP7SCyw,3,"Update:  Since the pandemic, this BurgerPalace isn't nearly as clean as it should be."
453,Mgr0fRzYE68_XTnRP7SCyw,3,The sugar containers on the table are grimy.
453,Mgr0fRzYE68_XTnRP7SCyw,3,"When nearly all of the plates at the salad bar are gone, you can see a very unclean corner filled with remnants of ""stuff""."
453,Mgr0fRzYE68_XTnRP7SCyw,3,"As we walked up to the restaurant, the trash receptacle outside was overloaded with trash laying around the door."
453,Mgr0fRzYE68_XTnRP7SCyw,3,There was also an old sweet potato laying in the foyer that clearly had been there for awhile.
453,Mgr0fRzYE68_XTnRP7SCyw,3,I watched on Monday an employee bringing out a tower of fresh ingredient replacements for the salad bar that where stacked on top of each other.
453,Mgr0fRzYE68_XTnRP7SCyw,3,Were the bottoms of those containers clean?
453,Mgr0fRzYE68_XTnRP7SCyw,3,"Who knows, as he put them each out on the salad bar."
453,Mgr0fRzYE68_XTnRP7SCyw,3,They should have been brought out on a tray.
453,Mgr0fRzYE68_XTnRP7SCyw,3,"It makes one wonder, what's happening in the kitchen?"
453,Mgr0fRzYE68_XTnRP7SCyw,3,How involved are employees with cleanliness?
453,Mgr0fRzYE68_XTnRP7SCyw,3,I'm guessing not very much when you see the front end of this BurgerPalace.
453,Mgr0fRzYE68_XTnRP7SCyw,3,"If they are struggling to gain more customers, attention to detail would help."
453,Mgr0fRzYE68_XTnRP7SCyw,3,Seriously.
454,JiWscoZDXQ_zHoDuNskBTw,4,Upon entering the restaurant we noticed that there were about 10 tables and 2 people at the bar.
454,JiWscoZDXQ_zHoDuNskBTw,4,We were greeted and seated by the hostess.
454,JiWscoZDXQ_zHoDuNskBTw,4,"while waiting for our server we noticed one waiter (Eric) running around, bartending, busing tables, running food and taking orders."
454,JiWscoZDXQ_zHoDuNskBTw,4,"While the manager, hostess and what appeared to be a new server standing around in the wait station."
454,JiWscoZDXQ_zHoDuNskBTw,4," Eric went above and beyond to make our experience pleasurable, while always having a smile on his face."
454,JiWscoZDXQ_zHoDuNskBTw,4, We couldn't believe the laziness of the manager and that she never stepped in to assist him or delegate other employees to help out during the Friday night dinner rush.
454,JiWscoZDXQ_zHoDuNskBTw,4," We can't say enough good things about Eric, you really have a gem of an employee"
455,b5NIoxfku1ZUzTaqKXSHDw,2,I haven't   been to BurgerPalace in a while after a bad time there before (hair was in my food).
455,b5NIoxfku1ZUzTaqKXSHDw,2, I order a new item on the menu a crispy fried chicken sandwich and tots.
455,b5NIoxfku1ZUzTaqKXSHDw,2,The plate was for a child.
455,b5NIoxfku1ZUzTaqKXSHDw,2, The sandwich was the size sandwich you would feed a child.
455,b5NIoxfku1ZUzTaqKXSHDw,2, My hubby had a salmon plate and it was overcooked I know I have many places I can go but here will no be the place.
456,sZdYlENcU1NAK19pnqcEXg,4,Omg I'm back on Team BurgerPalace I have not been here in so long.
456,sZdYlENcU1NAK19pnqcEXg,4,"Even when I used to go in the most frequent years, I only went to enjoy their cocktails."
456,sZdYlENcU1NAK19pnqcEXg,4,But this particular day I wanted salmon but did not want to leave the house for it.
456,sZdYlENcU1NAK19pnqcEXg,4,After googling and searching I found on GrubHub that BurgerPalace had salmon.
456,sZdYlENcU1NAK19pnqcEXg,4,This salmon was a hickory glaze and I got a side of two loaded baked potatoes.
456,sZdYlENcU1NAK19pnqcEXg,4,"I was so apprehensive about the entire thing, but I wanted to take a chance."
456,sZdYlENcU1NAK19pnqcEXg,4,I am glad that I did not hesitate because it truly pulled me back in to how much their dishes do not disappoint.
456,sZdYlENcU1NAK19pnqcEXg,4,Well some dishes!
456,sZdYlENcU1NAK19pnqcEXg,4,I cannot wait to go in person to see how delicious this is straight off of the grill.
456,sZdYlENcU1NAK19pnqcEXg,4,Even the bacon crumbles from the loaded baked potatoes were really really good.
456,sZdYlENcU1NAK19pnqcEXg,4,I was also excited to see that the butter and sour cream for the baked potatoes was completely separated in their little small containers.
456,sZdYlENcU1NAK19pnqcEXg,4,Oh the best part and I know it's more on the Grubhub side as well the delivery was amazingly fast.
456,sZdYlENcU1NAK19pnqcEXg,4,Good job BurgerPalace I will be back I am now a fan again.
457,WA8QNYypSeThsG3Sh7LX4A,3,3.5 stars.
457,WA8QNYypSeThsG3Sh7LX4A,3,"BurgerPalace is a casual restaurant chain that sells appetizers such as spinach artichoke dip and chicken quesadilla, main entrees such as burgers and baby-back ribs, and a small selection of desserts and beverages."
457,WA8QNYypSeThsG3Sh7LX4A,3,My husband and I ate inside this location of the restaurant one time for lunch.
457,WA8QNYypSeThsG3Sh7LX4A,3,The seating hostess promptly seated my husband and me at a table.
457,WA8QNYypSeThsG3Sh7LX4A,3,Soon our waiter arrived and took our orders.
457,WA8QNYypSeThsG3Sh7LX4A,3,I noticed that they both wore their face masks around their chins.
457,WA8QNYypSeThsG3Sh7LX4A,3,I did feel happy to see a container of hand sanitizer near the salad bar.
457,WA8QNYypSeThsG3Sh7LX4A,3,"The salad bar cost only $5 per person, and it included many ingredients to assemble a tasty salad as well as ready-made potato salad, macaroni salad, and some fruit."
457,WA8QNYypSeThsG3Sh7LX4A,3,"For our entrees, my fish and chips consisted of somewhat thin fish filets (my husband commented that they almost looked like fish sticks!) with tartar sauce and crispy French fries."
457,WA8QNYypSeThsG3Sh7LX4A,3,My husband ate a chicken sandwich.
457,WA8QNYypSeThsG3Sh7LX4A,3,"He does not like to discuss his food, so he simply said that this sandwich and the accompanying French fries tasted ""fine."""
457,WA8QNYypSeThsG3Sh7LX4A,3,"His drink was raspberry tea, and it had an extremely raspberry flavor that he liked."
457,WA8QNYypSeThsG3Sh7LX4A,3,The waiter did bring a drink refill.
457,WA8QNYypSeThsG3Sh7LX4A,3,The waiter also bought out our bill promptly.
457,WA8QNYypSeThsG3Sh7LX4A,3,The total price was $41 plus a tip.
457,WA8QNYypSeThsG3Sh7LX4A,3,He thanked us and told us to have a wonderful day.
457,WA8QNYypSeThsG3Sh7LX4A,3,"A couple of hours later at home, my husband commented that his stomach felt a little upset, but he did not get seriously sick."
458,rvR7qyjPhxUqZLbVLZTn7w,5,"Great tasting food, salad bar is filled with all kinds of options and Kelly was the best server hands down!"
458,rvR7qyjPhxUqZLbVLZTn7w,5,"Didnt come and check on us to often, cleared our table when needed, and was just a superior server!"
459,EC5Q85sXJHCRT1OBYClI3A,1,Me and my girlfriend went out for our anniversary on Saturday.
459,EC5Q85sXJHCRT1OBYClI3A,1,And it was absolutely horrible.
459,EC5Q85sXJHCRT1OBYClI3A,1,The service was great.
459,EC5Q85sXJHCRT1OBYClI3A,1,But the food was actually disgusting....the burger I got was not only undercooked.
459,EC5Q85sXJHCRT1OBYClI3A,1,It was not put together right at all.
459,EC5Q85sXJHCRT1OBYClI3A,1,Every drink we got had a dish watery taste.
459,EC5Q85sXJHCRT1OBYClI3A,1,And my girlfriend got the $15.00!
459,EC5Q85sXJHCRT1OBYClI3A,1,Mac and cheese and it was the nastiest thing I've ever had just all and all a really horrible place do not recommend.
460,n1ZP7jfZAsTcKv13auBg7g,1,"This is a follow up of my terrible meal 2 weeks ago, customer service got ahold of me by email to apologize and asked for my phone number to talk to me about this, well I'm still waiting for them to call me or respond to my email."
460,n1ZP7jfZAsTcKv13auBg7g,1,So much for trying to make things right..
460,n1ZP7jfZAsTcKv13auBg7g,1,Don't think I'll be back at any location.
461,9fVLLlDtpeWHsE94WHFqIA,2,I must have been mistaken in thinking this was a more upscale all-American type place.
461,9fVLLlDtpeWHsE94WHFqIA,2,This is an upscale train wreck.
461,9fVLLlDtpeWHsE94WHFqIA,2,I realize they oversat this poor waitress and none of this is her fault in the least.
461,9fVLLlDtpeWHsE94WHFqIA,2,But the food was terrible and the drink service was so delayed that I finished my meal and had time to post a review before we got our refills.
461,9fVLLlDtpeWHsE94WHFqIA,2,The drinks were fine.
461,9fVLLlDtpeWHsE94WHFqIA,2,But even a basic chicken salad was a clusterf*ck.
461,9fVLLlDtpeWHsE94WHFqIA,2,The mashed potatoes must have been sitting under a heat lamp since Moses parted the Red Sea.
461,9fVLLlDtpeWHsE94WHFqIA,2,And not sure what a was on top of the tilapia but it wasn't a cream sauce.
461,9fVLLlDtpeWHsE94WHFqIA,2,It was more like something that was lurking around the pasta sauce and something rubbed off on it.
461,9fVLLlDtpeWHsE94WHFqIA,2,At least the shrimp were not overcooked.
461,9fVLLlDtpeWHsE94WHFqIA,2,That's a plus.
461,9fVLLlDtpeWHsE94WHFqIA,2,The chicken sandwich was leaking.
461,9fVLLlDtpeWHsE94WHFqIA,2,That's the best I can explain it without further description.
461,9fVLLlDtpeWHsE94WHFqIA,2,We're regretting the decision to skip Sonic at this point.
461,9fVLLlDtpeWHsE94WHFqIA,2,Don't make that mistake too.
462,BMAi4om8xnHPWNfvIjzG3A,5,My wife and I went back to an old favorite last night and we thoroughly enjoyed Streetsboro's BurgerPalace and their special Hickory Bourbon smothered Salmon Steak platter which was served with al dente veggies (zucchini for my wife and broccoli for me) and potato.
462,BMAi4om8xnHPWNfvIjzG3A,5,"She had french fries that she claims were even better than what she remembers were really good fries from McDonalds, and I enjoyed a perfectly prepared baked potato with butter and sour cream (I topped mine with freshly ground black pepper of the highest quality, which is always right there in a grinder on the table at BurgerPalace."
462,BMAi4om8xnHPWNfvIjzG3A,5,"We arrived earlier than normal and were glad because it got very busy after 5:30, but our server, Jennifer, served us exceptionally well, thank you!"
463,ILgWnTfhmJEN2MKt2vG0qg,5,"Michelle was our server she was polite, .this server was on it, I waited for nothing she was attentive and quick."
463,ILgWnTfhmJEN2MKt2vG0qg,5,"The hot wing were delightfully delicious, the fish and chips fried perfectly."
463,ILgWnTfhmJEN2MKt2vG0qg,5," It was really good, my tea glass always full."
463,ILgWnTfhmJEN2MKt2vG0qg,5,Great Job!
464,XzBcGvneBKd5RN1g1ikAyw,1,"I was at the Streetsboro location yesterday, the one star is for Pam my waitress !!"
464,XzBcGvneBKd5RN1g1ikAyw,1,She was great
464,XzBcGvneBKd5RN1g1ikAyw,1,.The
464,XzBcGvneBKd5RN1g1ikAyw,1,food was awfull !!
464,XzBcGvneBKd5RN1g1ikAyw,1,"It was cold ,(both meals we asked to have it  reheated )"
464,XzBcGvneBKd5RN1g1ikAyw,1,I thought I was being picky until I asked my Friend .
464,XzBcGvneBKd5RN1g1ikAyw,1,And Hers was also cold.
464,XzBcGvneBKd5RN1g1ikAyw,1,She ordered a medium steak that was mid-rare and told me well it was a little better at least warm  
464,XzBcGvneBKd5RN1g1ikAyw,1,"The sampler platter of appetizers the pretzels were  ok cheese dip out of a jar not warm , cheese sticks were not hot as I took a bite the whole piece of cheese came out ."
464,XzBcGvneBKd5RN1g1ikAyw,1,There was nobody on the whole side due to COVID......another reason I felt our meals could have been better and at least hot .
464,XzBcGvneBKd5RN1g1ikAyw,1,Having to pay for salad separately from meal is bull crap .After paying 15.00 for entree
464,XzBcGvneBKd5RN1g1ikAyw,1,", Just an epic failure BurgerPalace I was a fan forever of your salad bar alone but you've lost 2 Loyal customers."
465,Entitujk-EdEneSeh82t6g,2,Clean.
465,Entitujk-EdEneSeh82t6g,2,"Food tasted decent, once the whole order arrived."
465,Entitujk-EdEneSeh82t6g,2,My husband's order was entered incorrectly and arrived 15 minutes after my meal.
465,Entitujk-EdEneSeh82t6g,2,A server apologized and corrected the order.
465,Entitujk-EdEneSeh82t6g,2,"If I had waited my food would be cold, so much for date night."
465,Entitujk-EdEneSeh82t6g,2,No offer of discount or anything else to comp the issue.
466,4dEbBURGXeMyLsbKBA2jGQ,1,Where to start with this.

466,4dEbBURGXeMyLsbKBA2jGQ,1,We arrived at the tail end of the lunch run (about 1:15).
466,4dEbBURGXeMyLsbKBA2jGQ,1,"We were seated fairly promptly, but had to wait 15 minutes or so to place our order."
466,4dEbBURGXeMyLsbKBA2jGQ,1,"We ordered simple items, a burger and fries, and a baked potato with soup and the salad bar."
466,4dEbBURGXeMyLsbKBA2jGQ,1,"As we waited for our food, we could hear someone screaming at an employee in the kitchen."
466,4dEbBURGXeMyLsbKBA2jGQ,1,"We continued to wait for about 45 minutes before giving up and asking our server for a check for the soup, salad, and our drinks."
466,4dEbBURGXeMyLsbKBA2jGQ,1,She apologized and said she would bring the check.
466,4dEbBURGXeMyLsbKBA2jGQ,1,"A few minutes later, a woman later identified as the manager showed up with our food."
466,4dEbBURGXeMyLsbKBA2jGQ,1,We told her that we no longer wanted it.
466,4dEbBURGXeMyLsbKBA2jGQ,1,"She was rude, started making excuses about how busy they were (half the tables were empty, there was only one large group)."
466,4dEbBURGXeMyLsbKBA2jGQ,1,"When we insisted on the check for what we had consumed, she got angry and stormed into the kitchen yelling at someone that if they were hungry, eat this!Our"
466,4dEbBURGXeMyLsbKBA2jGQ,1,server came back to the table and apologized again.
466,4dEbBURGXeMyLsbKBA2jGQ,1,We told her that we were sorry she had to work for such an unprofessional manager.
466,4dEbBURGXeMyLsbKBA2jGQ,1,"Needless to say, this was our last visit to that restaurant."

468,KQoheRzzDxfWHlf5yeC-dg,1,The seating area and the view were good however the service was extremely bad!
468,KQoheRzzDxfWHlf5yeC-dg,1,The staff was lack of training and it's a mess.
468,KQoheRzzDxfWHlf5yeC-dg,1,"First, nobody came after we seated for a long time."
468,KQoheRzzDxfWHlf5yeC-dg,1,"We asked, then a waitress who seemed very grumpy came and took our order."
468,KQoheRzzDxfWHlf5yeC-dg,1,"Then it took another super long time to get our drink, which was only part of our drinks."
468,KQoheRzzDxfWHlf5yeC-dg,1,"If you have an extra hour to waste and want to sit around and wait, then you could try it out."
469,p5PVDipN0fTcFpc8ytsqSQ,2,Dropped by this restaurant as the wife was hungry and it's been a long day being a tourist in the area.
469,p5PVDipN0fTcFpc8ytsqSQ,2,It was empty upon entering which is a obvious sign for the experience to come.
469,p5PVDipN0fTcFpc8ytsqSQ,2,"The menu is burgers, pasta and steak at any restaurant nearby."
469,p5PVDipN0fTcFpc8ytsqSQ,2,The price is rather high and the food lack presentation.
469,p5PVDipN0fTcFpc8ytsqSQ,2,I opted for the steak with mash and broccoli.
469,p5PVDipN0fTcFpc8ytsqSQ,2,My wife got the bacon burger with fries.
469,p5PVDipN0fTcFpc8ytsqSQ,2,"Overall, it was a decent meal to fill the hunger but nothing special with high price tag."
470,V2LI7bQhXqZDCFZjOnt4JQ,2,As others have said food is meh and service was slow.
470,V2LI7bQhXqZDCFZjOnt4JQ,2,"Chicken fingers, fries, shrimp all tasted like boxed frozen food."
470,V2LI7bQhXqZDCFZjOnt4JQ,2,Really really not worth the price you pay.
470,V2LI7bQhXqZDCFZjOnt4JQ,2,Seriously we only came here because other restaurants had long wait times versus this one was mostly empty but avoid our mistrals and just get fast food like Wendy's or something.
470,V2LI7bQhXqZDCFZjOnt4JQ,2,Don't get me wrong food was edible and tasted alright hence the two stars but you can go to the grocery store to pick up a box and heat some up yourself
471,mHRz9WYp6j-IYEK0Vkxr3g,4,"It was our first night in Niagara Falls and we wanted to go full tourist, so BurgerPalace seemed like a pretty solid bet."
471,mHRz9WYp6j-IYEK0Vkxr3g,4,We were almost immediately shown to a pretty sweet booth - god I love me a good booth - and immediately began perusing the menu.
471,mHRz9WYp6j-IYEK0Vkxr3g,4,"I decided that a hamburger was probably the thing to get in a joint like this, so I went with the Smokehouse Burger (""Cheddar cheese, applewood smoked bacon, barbecue sauce, and crisp onion rings."
471,mHRz9WYp6j-IYEK0Vkxr3g,4,""")It arrived a short time later and sure looked impressive."
471,mHRz9WYp6j-IYEK0Vkxr3g,4,"It was almost intimidatingly tall but I managed to take an initial bite and although this'll never be mistaken for a top-notch burger, I enjoyed the heck out of it."
471,mHRz9WYp6j-IYEK0Vkxr3g,4,"The bacon and onion rings gave it a nice smoky flavor and I enjoyed the sweet, tangy barbecue sauce."
471,mHRz9WYp6j-IYEK0Vkxr3g,4,The patty was in memorable but fine.
471,mHRz9WYp6j-IYEK0Vkxr3g,4,"I should also mention the fries were piping hot, which is always a pleasant surprise."
471,mHRz9WYp6j-IYEK0Vkxr3g,4,"The service was friendly and attentive, too."
471,mHRz9WYp6j-IYEK0Vkxr3g,4,We were too full for dessert but I'd definitely be into returning someday to sample their sweeter options.
472,B6n2rAfsSSCGJbyIa_To6g,1,This restaurant has terrible service and the food was extremely expensive.
472,B6n2rAfsSSCGJbyIa_To6g,1,What was served to us looked like it was thrown together in a rush and it didn't even taste good.
472,B6n2rAfsSSCGJbyIa_To6g,1,I was expecting something fantastic with the prices being so high.
472,B6n2rAfsSSCGJbyIa_To6g,1,I was so wrong.
472,B6n2rAfsSSCGJbyIa_To6g,1,There was 8 of us in our party and no one was happy with their meal.
472,B6n2rAfsSSCGJbyIa_To6g,1,Our waiter didn't even check on us once.
472,B6n2rAfsSSCGJbyIa_To6g,1,The drinks were even horrible.
472,B6n2rAfsSSCGJbyIa_To6g,1, I do not recommend this place at all.
473,sIJD0hEOLw3_AXa74-Ux6g,5,Hidden gem.
473,sIJD0hEOLw3_AXa74-Ux6g,5,Honestly not sure  why the low reviews but the 4 of us had a great experience.
473,sIJD0hEOLw3_AXa74-Ux6g,5,NO line up.
473,sIJD0hEOLw3_AXa74-Ux6g,5,Quick service.
473,sIJD0hEOLw3_AXa74-Ux6g,5,Great food.
473,sIJD0hEOLw3_AXa74-Ux6g,5,Accommodated gluten and keto!
473,sIJD0hEOLw3_AXa74-Ux6g,5,"Meanwhile people are lined up at Kelsey, having to wait an hour and inhale street traffic fumes, this patio is on the upper level."
473,sIJD0hEOLw3_AXa74-Ux6g,5,Nice and private with great views of the falls and the strip!
473,sIJD0hEOLw3_AXa74-Ux6g,5,Go and enjoy
474,lhutbQuooNvgiyO0syTsJw,1,The food is so overpriced for garbage quality.
474,lhutbQuooNvgiyO0syTsJw,1,May as well go to the keg for those prices.
474,lhutbQuooNvgiyO0syTsJw,1,The waitress was complaining about her job the entire time.. TO CUSTOMERS.
474,lhutbQuooNvgiyO0syTsJw,1,Completely unprofessional and such a bad experience.
474,lhutbQuooNvgiyO0syTsJw,1,I actually made a Yelp account just so I could complain about this failure of an establishment.
475,QVOqx-kqxYM6jhMiRyg5DA,1,Don't go there!
475,QVOqx-kqxYM6jhMiRyg5DA,1,They're giving you frozen food with bad serviceWe
475,QVOqx-kqxYM6jhMiRyg5DA,1,went last night and firstly got an entree wrong.
475,QVOqx-kqxYM6jhMiRyg5DA,1,Ordered one thing and the server totally denied and said that he thought it was the other one.
475,QVOqx-kqxYM6jhMiRyg5DA,1,Then they totally forgot to use salt in a few things.
475,QVOqx-kqxYM6jhMiRyg5DA,1,Their burger & mashed potatoes.
475,QVOqx-kqxYM6jhMiRyg5DA,1,We had to ask for napkins.
475,QVOqx-kqxYM6jhMiRyg5DA,1,Then we had to ask for ketchupThen there was no salt pepper on the table.
475,QVOqx-kqxYM6jhMiRyg5DA,1,Don't waste your money.
475,QVOqx-kqxYM6jhMiRyg5DA,1,There are plenty of nice places around
476,MV2zXN8oWDG8O0M1XQ8OPQ,3,Definitely a different menu post pandemic.
476,MV2zXN8oWDG8O0M1XQ8OPQ,3,The menu now is more like Chili's or Applebee's.
476,MV2zXN8oWDG8O0M1XQ8OPQ,3,I always like going in their pre-pandemic and sitting down to where I felt it was a real meal.
476,MV2zXN8oWDG8O0M1XQ8OPQ,3,Now it's fast food.
476,MV2zXN8oWDG8O0M1XQ8OPQ,3,I ordered a Philly cheesesteak from the menu and it looks nothing like the picture on the menu.
476,MV2zXN8oWDG8O0M1XQ8OPQ,3,It was a very soggy raw cod with cheddar cheese sauce.
476,MV2zXN8oWDG8O0M1XQ8OPQ,3,Again nothing like what the menu pictured it to be.
476,MV2zXN8oWDG8O0M1XQ8OPQ,3,Very disappointing

477,TT2ggwr2_Mqr0x7lF6wRHA,3,wife and I local so we have been dining off an on at the Vero Beach BurgerPalace since it opened.
477,TT2ggwr2_Mqr0x7lF6wRHA,3,They consistently have a decent salad bar.
477,TT2ggwr2_Mqr0x7lF6wRHA,3, You have to work at it and special order items but you make it an okay choice for a low-carb-based meal.
477,TT2ggwr2_Mqr0x7lF6wRHA,3,Date of this visit 1-13-2022.Kelsie is always our waitress whenever possible.
477,TT2ggwr2_Mqr0x7lF6wRHA,3," She always remembers us, what we like and how we like it."
477,TT2ggwr2_Mqr0x7lF6wRHA,3, She is always kind and friendly as well as quick and efficient at serving us.
477,TT2ggwr2_Mqr0x7lF6wRHA,3,"In my experience, it is hit or miss at many BurgerPalace as to whether or not they will cook items, like their salmon, to order (i.e. medium) or not."
477,TT2ggwr2_Mqr0x7lF6wRHA,3," This one does which makes for a perfectly mouther-watering, buttery delicious piece of fish."
477,TT2ggwr2_Mqr0x7lF6wRHA,3,"We usually only order the salad bar and add grilled chicken and/or grilled salmon which they prepare very nicely (except with an occasion new cook, then it may require a re-order).What"
477,TT2ggwr2_Mqr0x7lF6wRHA,3,would
477,TT2ggwr2_Mqr0x7lF6wRHA,3,make it a 4-5 star review for me?
477,TT2ggwr2_Mqr0x7lF6wRHA,3,More grilled and healthy entrée and options that are scratch cooked with fresh spices and herds and not heavy starchy sauces.
477,TT2ggwr2_Mqr0x7lF6wRHA,3,"In my opinion the menu is mostly starch heavy, fried, or heavily sauce/gravy heavy that makes them taste like every other processed food, fast food chain."
477,TT2ggwr2_Mqr0x7lF6wRHA,3,The Pic's are from a previouse visit
478,wPrWzEzm8XR6a9hr3v9cXg,1,Ordered food well in advance then spent almost 20 minutes waiting in lobby.
478,wPrWzEzm8XR6a9hr3v9cXg,1,Figure out your timing people it's not that hard for goodness sakes.
479,xsXCDtnGOncnnsaLc73O3A,5,Good food great service.
479,xsXCDtnGOncnnsaLc73O3A,5,Stopped on our way home and missed having a BurgerPalace Did not disappoint
480,YSdJp0SpDiiC4Lf4nFXxGw,4,This place needs more than a 2 star overall review.
480,YSdJp0SpDiiC4Lf4nFXxGw,4,I was in town at the casino and we stopped in for lunch.
480,YSdJp0SpDiiC4Lf4nFXxGw,4,The food was not which to die for but as a picky eater I found it to be acceptable.
480,YSdJp0SpDiiC4Lf4nFXxGw,4,We had the glazed chicken and mozzarella sticks with the salad bar for both of us.
480,YSdJp0SpDiiC4Lf4nFXxGw,4,"Everything was fresh, hot, didn't seem like it was sitting around all day and night, staff was friendly and chatty, alcohol was good and the price was a little high but ie the 4 star and not 5."
480,YSdJp0SpDiiC4Lf4nFXxGw,4,I'll eat here again.
481,U64t5qQbPa2HLuicAh1q4g,1,Restaurant has brand new cooks and wait staff.
481,U64t5qQbPa2HLuicAh1q4g,1,"Our order was messed up from the get go, starting with the server forgetting to click send on the computer."
481,U64t5qQbPa2HLuicAh1q4g,1,We waited almost 2 hours for our meals.
481,U64t5qQbPa2HLuicAh1q4g,1,Then food was lousy!
481,U64t5qQbPa2HLuicAh1q4g,1, My daughters burger tasted funny.
481,U64t5qQbPa2HLuicAh1q4g,1,Our fried shrimp was barely fried.
481,U64t5qQbPa2HLuicAh1q4g,1,We just gave up.
481,U64t5qQbPa2HLuicAh1q4g,1,The manager deducted all the food.
481,U64t5qQbPa2HLuicAh1q4g,1,He was at his wits end with all the staff.
481,U64t5qQbPa2HLuicAh1q4g,1,The young man doing hostess duty and busing duty was absolutely wonderful!!!  
481,U64t5qQbPa2HLuicAh1q4g,1,"Don't bother driving in this restaurant's direction, it's worth the wait at any other place."
481,U64t5qQbPa2HLuicAh1q4g,1,Will never go there again!
482,8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,I usually go here about once a week.
482,8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,Service at the bar is always friendly and good is decent for this area.
482,8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,"Tonight, not so much."
482,8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,I sat at the bar as I usually do and waited for about 5 minutes which is normal and I don't mind to be honest since there is only one bartender and no servers in that part of the restaurant.
482,8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,"I wasn't greeted by the bartender, instead was looked at rather rudely and asked if I was picking up an order."
482,8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,"I said no I am here to order and she just said, for here?"
482,8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,"Anyway, was given a menu, wasn't asked if I would like anything to drink so I asked for a yuengling, was told they didn't have it so asked for a corona."
482,8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,"Was given the beer with no lime or a ""here you go""."
482,8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,Was it a little busy?
482,8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,"Yea, was it my fault, nope."
482,8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,"When I paid, no have a good night or anything."
482,8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,I have worked in the food and bar industry for my whole working career and cannot stand rude service.
482,8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,"If I see you being cordial with other customers and not me for some odd reason, not sure what the deal is."
482,8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,I'll walk right out if that person is behind the bar when I go back.
482,8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,Now the food.
482,8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,I never expect something amazing since it's a chain restaurant but it's food.
482,8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,I've never really gotten anything I don't like.
482,8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,"However, this time I knew the burger was a frozen Patty that you can get in bulk, you could just taste an odd flavor."
482,8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,There were two tiny pieces of onion on it and rotten lettuce.
482,8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,"I understand that meat is expensive right now and the place may need to cut some corners by ordering prefrozen beef, but lettuce and onions tho??"
482,8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,You can get ecoli from bad lettuce and it is super cheap.
482,8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,Just seems places don't care anymore to serve decent fresh food and have a friendly bartender.
483,xPKITBHuJB9NvxshIyYizA,1,Place is not good.
483,xPKITBHuJB9NvxshIyYizA,1, Food was super suspect.
483,xPKITBHuJB9NvxshIyYizA,1, Queso and chips was like a humus.
483,xPKITBHuJB9NvxshIyYizA,1," Asked for more chips, never came."
483,xPKITBHuJB9NvxshIyYizA,1, Salmon was decent.
483,xPKITBHuJB9NvxshIyYizA,1, Steak was junk.
484,XiaD2S7Vc6Bocg-d4S88FQ,2,The waiter was one of the best we have ever had!
484,XiaD2S7Vc6Bocg-d4S88FQ,2,His name is Lowell C.
484,XiaD2S7Vc6Bocg-d4S88FQ,2,He should have a job at a classier establishment.
484,XiaD2S7Vc6Bocg-d4S88FQ,2,"He is on the ball, friendly and pleasant."
484,XiaD2S7Vc6Bocg-d4S88FQ,2,The french fries were excellent.
484,XiaD2S7Vc6Bocg-d4S88FQ,2,Floors need major attention.
484,XiaD2S7Vc6Bocg-d4S88FQ,2,Very sticky.
484,XiaD2S7Vc6Bocg-d4S88FQ,2,"I thought I had stepped in gum, but nope."
484,XiaD2S7Vc6Bocg-d4S88FQ,2,Carpet and tile very sticky.
484,XiaD2S7Vc6Bocg-d4S88FQ,2,Boyfriend noticed it too.
484,XiaD2S7Vc6Bocg-d4S88FQ,2,Chicken was tough and soda was flat.
484,XiaD2S7Vc6Bocg-d4S88FQ,2,The dining room is open even though business looks deserted from the road.
485,g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,My husband and I went to this location to celebrate our wedding anniversary.
485,g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,What a total nightmare!
485,g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,We sat down at the bar and ordered drinks.
485,g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,I ordered a Long Island iced tea.
485,g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,Being a former bartender I could tell that there was almost no alcohol in it at all.
485,g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,It was so sweet that I couldn't even drink it.
485,g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,"I sent it back and ended up ordering a beer which I don't like to drink, but I knew that it was something that the bartender couldn't screw up."
485,g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,We ended up ordering the queso cheese and chips as an appetizer.
485,g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,The order literally came out within two minutes.
485,g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,"The cheese wasn't even warm, and the chips were totally stale."
485,g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,"They ended up sending it back to the kitchen, and all they did was reheat the cheese, and the cook made fresh chips."
485,g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,The cheese was still very bland and did not have much flavor.
485,g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,Two strikes against them so far!
485,g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,I ended up ordering chicken wings as my entrée.
485,g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,"Most of them were very small wings, smaller than my pinky finger."
485,g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,"There were only two large wings that were in there, and they were full of fat!"
485,g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,They were absolutely disgusting!
485,g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,I couldn't even eat them.
485,g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,Thanks for ruining our wedding anniversary dinner BurgerPalace in Charles town West Virginia!
485,g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,Three strikes and you're out.
485,g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,Never had such a horrible restaurant experience in my life.
486,2loApySXvuoguBEMPrqg9Q,3,Ugh.
486,2loApySXvuoguBEMPrqg9Q,3,So hungry figured a salad can't be that bad... and it was surprisingly pretty tasty but man it smells like it needs to be washed in there.
486,2loApySXvuoguBEMPrqg9Q,3,"Girl helping with to go orders using her fingers to clean her eyes, playing with her hair - lawd take me now."
486,2loApySXvuoguBEMPrqg9Q,3,Everybody looked like they woke up and went to work - no effort.
486,2loApySXvuoguBEMPrqg9Q,3,I'm bougie don't trust me if you like side of the road food go for it.
486,2loApySXvuoguBEMPrqg9Q,3,Me and my household staying out this place.
487,jEidw5OF7-sCWYx7rv8zVg,1,"Poor customer service, no greeting, no eye contact, appear as annoyed when you request items that are missing from the order you paid for, no sense of urgency, no accommodations made for inconveniences, no manners in general."
487,jEidw5OF7-sCWYx7rv8zVg,1,To go orders treated as trash and thrown together and missing items.
488,5TIE08D_g-22WSsDZGT31g,1,Every time I order online or on the phone my food is never ready when I get there I still have to wait for 20 to 30 min  to get it and my break is only 30 min
489,CJzk5rdK6j9yv5uhB_G-NQ,1,"Like the previous review mentioned, this location deserves ZERO stars."
489,CJzk5rdK6j9yv5uhB_G-NQ,1,It takes a lot for me to write a review about anything but they had this one coming.
489,CJzk5rdK6j9yv5uhB_G-NQ,1,Let's start with the fact that my friend and I both got food poisoning from the salad bar of which we are still medicating for.
489,CJzk5rdK6j9yv5uhB_G-NQ,1,Let's also add the fact that we weren't seated for more than 5 minutes because NO ONE HERE WORKS.
489,CJzk5rdK6j9yv5uhB_G-NQ,1,I'm sure the GM would be shocked to know the employees here stand around like a gaggle of geese gossiping and joking around instead of serving paying customers.
489,CJzk5rdK6j9yv5uhB_G-NQ,1,"The salad bar was lacking several items and I had to ask the server to refill eggs, croutons, corn, cranberries and several other things TWICE and it never happened."
489,CJzk5rdK6j9yv5uhB_G-NQ,1,She didn't bother to check on us for anything until we were ready to go so she could get a fat tip and had the audacity to complain when I gave her 12% out of decency.
489,CJzk5rdK6j9yv5uhB_G-NQ,1,She literally earned NOTHING but I was raised to tip at least 10% even if the service is terrible and the fact she loudly complained making a scene in the restaurant is an experience I have never had before.
489,CJzk5rdK6j9yv5uhB_G-NQ,1,The entire staff should be fired here.
489,CJzk5rdK6j9yv5uhB_G-NQ,1,This is the worst Ruby's I've ever been to and amongst the worst 3 dining experiences I've ever had.
489,CJzk5rdK6j9yv5uhB_G-NQ,1,0/5 DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!
490,T-_uxxtOAyqEyt3h-cOhng,1,If I could rate this location a zero for customer service I would.
490,T-_uxxtOAyqEyt3h-cOhng,1, I had been a frequent visitor of this location.
490,T-_uxxtOAyqEyt3h-cOhng,1,There's never no one there to place to go orders.
490,T-_uxxtOAyqEyt3h-cOhng,1," The employees walk around and ignore you standing without asking for help and get an attitude when you do ask for help, siting it's not their job(bartender)."
490,T-_uxxtOAyqEyt3h-cOhng,1,The female day bartender is extremely rude and argumentative.
490,T-_uxxtOAyqEyt3h-cOhng,1, I have decided to no longer frequent this location as the customer service is just NONE and AGGRAVATING.
490,T-_uxxtOAyqEyt3h-cOhng,1, I waited 10 minutes for someone to place my order and this was the person clocking in for work and another 20 minutes for my order that I was told would take 10 minutes.
490,T-_uxxtOAyqEyt3h-cOhng,1, I had to inquire about my order and of course I could tell it had been sitting around as it was not warm.
490,T-_uxxtOAyqEyt3h-cOhng,1, I work 5 minutes away and wasted my entire lunch dealing with unprofessional and rude employees.
490,T-_uxxtOAyqEyt3h-cOhng,1, It starts at the top.
490,T-_uxxtOAyqEyt3h-cOhng,1, Management apparently  allow this type of behavior.
490,T-_uxxtOAyqEyt3h-cOhng,1, DON'T WASTE YOUR PRECIOUS TIME AT THE  SULLIVAN ROAD LOCATION.
490,T-_uxxtOAyqEyt3h-cOhng,1, HORRIBLE SERVICE.
491,Ti_vODmrX2G-kQXQFbOKXQ,4,"Look, staffing shortages are bad everywhere."
491,Ti_vODmrX2G-kQXQFbOKXQ,4,"If you can't be patient, then cook your own darn food."
491,Ti_vODmrX2G-kQXQFbOKXQ,4,The staff I dealt with at this BurgerPalace was excellent.
491,Ti_vODmrX2G-kQXQFbOKXQ,4,"There weren't enough of them for the amount of filled tables, but they were working their tails off and I appreciated them very much."
491,Ti_vODmrX2G-kQXQFbOKXQ,4,I think my waitress (twice) was named Nelly (Nellie?) and she was an angel.
491,Ti_vODmrX2G-kQXQFbOKXQ,4,"Let's not forget that the most important part of a restaurant's business is the food, eh?"
491,Ti_vODmrX2G-kQXQFbOKXQ,4,It is all excellent.
491,Ti_vODmrX2G-kQXQFbOKXQ,4,Somehow the kitchen is able to crank out amazing food even though I'm sure they're short staffed too.
491,Ti_vODmrX2G-kQXQFbOKXQ,4,The bar makes amazing drinks and the food is good.
491,Ti_vODmrX2G-kQXQFbOKXQ,4,"If you can get over yourself about waiting a bit to get your stuff, then this is the perfect place for you."
491,Ti_vODmrX2G-kQXQFbOKXQ,4,Try it out...seriously.
492,OI568gtIzyO1if0wQhGp4g,5,The garden bar was so great!
492,OI568gtIzyO1if0wQhGp4g,5,Ms. Tequila you are so sweet and funny!
492,OI568gtIzyO1if0wQhGp4g,5,My friend and I had a great time and look forward to coming back
493,51c766ovJoE3z7PeXROUCw,3,Slow being seated(10mins from the time we walked in).
493,51c766ovJoE3z7PeXROUCw,3,There were only 2 of us.
493,51c766ovJoE3z7PeXROUCw,3,Our waiter was bussing tables and being hostess.
493,51c766ovJoE3z7PeXROUCw,3,"After bein seated l, we were given menus and she dissapeared for another 15mins."
493,51c766ovJoE3z7PeXROUCw,3,We just decided to go get the salad bar since we could serve ourselves.
493,51c766ovJoE3z7PeXROUCw,3,It was not busy they are just slow!
494,QJMlPez8tudGCcVrECSFOg,3,This was a mixed experience.
494,QJMlPez8tudGCcVrECSFOg,3,"On the plus side, the food was surprisingly good."
494,QJMlPez8tudGCcVrECSFOg,3,"I had the 8 oz sirloin, and it came medium, as ordered."
494,QJMlPez8tudGCcVrECSFOg,3,Tasted good and served hot.
494,QJMlPez8tudGCcVrECSFOg,3,Fries and broccoli decent.
494,QJMlPez8tudGCcVrECSFOg,3,"That said, service was painfully slow."
494,QJMlPez8tudGCcVrECSFOg,3,"I came in a large party, around 6:30."
494,QJMlPez8tudGCcVrECSFOg,3,"We didn't get out til 9, and my water was never refilled in 2.5 hours, despite me asking."
494,QJMlPez8tudGCcVrECSFOg,3,"Probably not a bad option for a small group or family, but look elsewhere for larger parties."
495,DBztaHu63EQBtTrkf4_0XQ,1,"Ordered two appetizers, the coconut shrimp and loaded fried, as a Grubhub order to be delivered to the hotel directly behind the restaurant."
495,DBztaHu63EQBtTrkf4_0XQ,1,I was traveling alone with my daughter and we got into our hotel around 8 so wanted to have something delivered quickly.
495,DBztaHu63EQBtTrkf4_0XQ,1,We ordered the 2 appetizers with the delivery fee and tip our total was $36.00.
495,DBztaHu63EQBtTrkf4_0XQ,1,"When our food arrived... over an hour later, my daughters 6 pieces of shrimp were cold and my ""fries"" that had to replaced with tots since they were out of fries, were cold as well!"
495,DBztaHu63EQBtTrkf4_0XQ,1,The loaded fries are supposed to come topped with queso and shredded cheese.
495,DBztaHu63EQBtTrkf4_0XQ,1,The food was so cold the queso had hardened!
495,DBztaHu63EQBtTrkf4_0XQ,1,It was a total waste of money.
496,ecsKAD3gKEIaD4kg7KFDew,1,"Went into the dining room for supper at around 8:15 and waited 30 minutes before going to the bar and was asked  ""What""?"
496,ecsKAD3gKEIaD4kg7KFDew,1,Really that's how you greet someone.
496,ecsKAD3gKEIaD4kg7KFDew,1,I just left.
496,ecsKAD3gKEIaD4kg7KFDew,1,No wonder this place is dead and has 2 stars.
496,ecsKAD3gKEIaD4kg7KFDew,1,I went to Malone's across the street.
497,k0YcQt7Hue04lvcsCu2Huw,1,No one was at the front to seat our party.
497,k0YcQt7Hue04lvcsCu2Huw,1,A young lady who was there waiting on here take out food that should have been an hour prior motioned to someone around the corner.
497,k0YcQt7Hue04lvcsCu2Huw,1,The manager and an employee emerged and began arguing in front of us.
497,k0YcQt7Hue04lvcsCu2Huw,1,Two RED flags in less than 5 minutes and we should have left immediately but decided to stay and dine in.
497,k0YcQt7Hue04lvcsCu2Huw,1,Tables weren't clean and restaurant was nearly empty.
497,k0YcQt7Hue04lvcsCu2Huw,1,Bottom line it took nearly an hour for our food to arrive.
497,k0YcQt7Hue04lvcsCu2Huw,1,Service was subpar.
497,k0YcQt7Hue04lvcsCu2Huw,1,We will not visit this RT again.
497,k0YcQt7Hue04lvcsCu2Huw,1,This is disheartening because we would eat here at times passing through Atlanta before COVID pandemic.
497,k0YcQt7Hue04lvcsCu2Huw,1,Should have read reviews before dining because each conveyed the truth.
497,k0YcQt7Hue04lvcsCu2Huw,1,Complete overall needed.
498,yxPSc-pkUhqYladL9kWxAg,1,We were in a hurry to leave town.
498,yxPSc-pkUhqYladL9kWxAg,1,So going to Ruby's our fave in Pendacola.
498,yxPSc-pkUhqYladL9kWxAg,1,But here we waited and waited and waited.
498,yxPSc-pkUhqYladL9kWxAg,1,The hostess literally dragged her feet.
498,yxPSc-pkUhqYladL9kWxAg,1,A small beer arrived about a half hour later.
498,yxPSc-pkUhqYladL9kWxAg,1,An hour later and still no food!
498,yxPSc-pkUhqYladL9kWxAg,1,If I could give negative stars I would.
498,yxPSc-pkUhqYladL9kWxAg,1,We finally left after much patience.
498,yxPSc-pkUhqYladL9kWxAg,1,Unbelievable!!!
499,-vq0lULgtmS4IB22qxIeFg,1,Slow!
499,-vq0lULgtmS4IB22qxIeFg,1, Don't go here unless you have a lot of time.
499,-vq0lULgtmS4IB22qxIeFg,1,   30 minutes to get a beer after ordering!
499,-vq0lULgtmS4IB22qxIeFg,1, Still waiting for food an hour after ordering.
499,-vq0lULgtmS4IB22qxIeFg,1, Not even busy at all.
500,09xmiKCDfml8VocxRFe9RQ,1,"High priced, frozen cooked."
500,09xmiKCDfml8VocxRFe9RQ,1,Hamburger was tasteless and fries cold and soft.
500,09xmiKCDfml8VocxRFe9RQ,1,Do not recommend.
501,45vVtkNvTaFracbSrJkbJw,1,Went here for random dinner and had to wait incredibly long to be seated.
501,45vVtkNvTaFracbSrJkbJw,1,When we got there it wasn't even busy.
501,45vVtkNvTaFracbSrJkbJw,1,The hostess was very incompetent.
501,45vVtkNvTaFracbSrJkbJw,1,She just kept waking back and forth not giving any update on the wait time.
501,45vVtkNvTaFracbSrJkbJw,1,Once we finally were seated our waiter kept asking if we wanted to sit in the front instead even after saying we were fine where we were.
501,45vVtkNvTaFracbSrJkbJw,1,The food was decent and came out in a timely manner.
501,45vVtkNvTaFracbSrJkbJw,1,Definitely train your employees on basic customer service skills..
502,3T3VkMIdT-aqgBeOSjfGnw,1,This location is disgusting!!!!
502,3T3VkMIdT-aqgBeOSjfGnw,1,"When we walked in, we thought we were at an abandoned Piccadilly's!"
502,3T3VkMIdT-aqgBeOSjfGnw,1,"The salad bar is like right past the front entrance (think summertime, now think flies...flying everything), the set-up and decor if you can it that is totally gross and was a total turn-off."
502,3T3VkMIdT-aqgBeOSjfGnw,1,The floor was filthy and after we were seated we look to the the right and some unfit parent has allowed their non-talented child to scribble mess all over the wall in crayon...
502,3T3VkMIdT-aqgBeOSjfGnw,1,WTF allows this???
502,3T3VkMIdT-aqgBeOSjfGnw,1,"And what's really disturbing is that the establishment did not even remotely try to remove it or paint over it, but felt it was ok to seat customers next to it?"
502,3T3VkMIdT-aqgBeOSjfGnw,1,?
502,3T3VkMIdT-aqgBeOSjfGnw,1,"The service was....I'm not sure how to describe...her intentions were sincere, but she yapped way too much (not in the mood to hear anything when your food is unappetizing), she kept coming to our table every 5 minutes to check, yet kept bringing wrong sh!@ and it was beyond annoying!"
502,3T3VkMIdT-aqgBeOSjfGnw,1,"The cheeseburger was, ugh, could've gotten a better one at BK, asked for everything on side, but of course it came with everything on it, my friends asked for no sour cream on dried-out potatoes and of course it came dripping and oozing with sour cream"
502,3T3VkMIdT-aqgBeOSjfGnw,1,", we asked for very little ice in our drinks and the glass comes filled to the top (we ask the waitress for a glass and spoon to take out all of the ice, she watches us do this, yet NEVER offers to have the drinks remade)....and the only response we get from the waitress is, ""I told them too, I told them too."""
502,3T3VkMIdT-aqgBeOSjfGnw,1,"Uh, that's not a an appropriate response if you keep delivering the wrong sh!@ to people's table."
502,3T3VkMIdT-aqgBeOSjfGnw,1,Will NEVER EVER come to this location again!
503,Ay4ewyM_sjFXJxT_ehzdaw,1,Wait time was just horrible.
503,Ay4ewyM_sjFXJxT_ehzdaw,1,Server was more worried about other things then our table.
503,Ay4ewyM_sjFXJxT_ehzdaw,1,Went to the gas staion after to buy things to eat for dinner.
503,Ay4ewyM_sjFXJxT_ehzdaw,1,If they really cared about good food and service they would fire the entire crew.
503,Ay4ewyM_sjFXJxT_ehzdaw,1,Hire someone to come in and clean the place.
503,Ay4ewyM_sjFXJxT_ehzdaw,1,Then do a regrand opening.
504,lcYvu8o-Wzfdv6xHtpzC7Q,1,Horrible service!
504,lcYvu8o-Wzfdv6xHtpzC7Q,1,Staff doesn't give a damn.
504,lcYvu8o-Wzfdv6xHtpzC7Q,1,They act like you are bothering them to get service.
504,lcYvu8o-Wzfdv6xHtpzC7Q,1,Everyone is in the kitchen and NO ONE is on the floor...not even a bartender.
504,lcYvu8o-Wzfdv6xHtpzC7Q,1,People are wondering if they are closed.
504,lcYvu8o-Wzfdv6xHtpzC7Q,1,The manager shld be fired for a piss poor staff.
504,lcYvu8o-Wzfdv6xHtpzC7Q,1,The walls are filthy in the booths.
504,lcYvu8o-Wzfdv6xHtpzC7Q,1,Gross!!
505,EWPktxGrTiIho5XsGzF-LA,1,Visiting from out of town
505,EWPktxGrTiIho5XsGzF-LA,1,and
505,EWPktxGrTiIho5XsGzF-LA,1,came in for a late lunch after traveling.
505,EWPktxGrTiIho5XsGzF-LA,1,"We were a party of three and came in the middle of the afternoon and though the restaurant was empty except for the bar, we waited for 5-10 min to be seated."
505,EWPktxGrTiIho5XsGzF-LA,1,"When someone came to seat us, she said that she saw us waiting but did not apologize for making us wait or offer a reason as to why."
505,EWPktxGrTiIho5XsGzF-LA,1,Our server was polite and friendly but was not very attentive; it took a long time for her to come back and take our order.
505,EWPktxGrTiIho5XsGzF-LA,1,The restaurant remained fairly empty during our time there and our appetizer and food still took longer than it should've (2 hamburgers and a ceaser salad).
505,EWPktxGrTiIho5XsGzF-LA,1,"When our food did come, she brought us a salad without any silverware."
505,EWPktxGrTiIho5XsGzF-LA,1,"When we asked her to bring silverware, she said she would but never came back."
505,EWPktxGrTiIho5XsGzF-LA,1,We had to go up to the bar to request them.
505,EWPktxGrTiIho5XsGzF-LA,1,I would not recommend coming back.
505,EWPktxGrTiIho5XsGzF-LA,1,The food was okay but wait staff had poor customer service.
506,5WmJBEg4e2L8Hi4qSJapLQ,5,"Good service , excellant salad bar . Generous drinks .worth the money more than other comparable chain restaurants."
507,Jjj4xvhi78_g4L6pnwZWfQ,2,"Got a few items to go, including two Cobb Salads."
507,Jjj4xvhi78_g4L6pnwZWfQ,2,They forgot the egg on both and were closed by the time I noticed.
508,t3xgOWYCu7aB6mTZauNNmg,5,Luke & Dalton we're our bartenders and they both were absolutely phenomenal!
508,t3xgOWYCu7aB6mTZauNNmg,5,"As Luke was coming off of shift, Dalton took over our check at the bar."
508,t3xgOWYCu7aB6mTZauNNmg,5,"My fiancé & myself both ordered hot & dirty martinis, one set from Luke and my fiancé's second from Dalton and they both made the perfect build of the cocktail."
508,t3xgOWYCu7aB6mTZauNNmg,5,"Food was also spectacular for a chain, we have had such luck at our local RT in upstate NY."
508,t3xgOWYCu7aB6mTZauNNmg,5,Highly recommend Somerset!
509,muka2I_-aW7hU6fBeqQTmw,3,Understaffed and you can tell.
509,muka2I_-aW7hU6fBeqQTmw,3,The staff was nice and the food was good.
509,muka2I_-aW7hU6fBeqQTmw,3,"The staff wore masks, some under the nose, but still better than many other places."
509,muka2I_-aW7hU6fBeqQTmw,3,One of our meals didn't get their side of mashed potatoes until we were leaving.
509,muka2I_-aW7hU6fBeqQTmw,3,The waiter put it in a to go box which was nice but a little frustrating that it wasn't served with the meal.
509,muka2I_-aW7hU6fBeqQTmw,3,"Overall, okay."
510,r2JZDGWoGNweOww6VZNSNA,5,BurgerPalace in Somerset is a good restaurant .
510,r2JZDGWoGNweOww6VZNSNA,5,Everyone wears a mask and they seem to clean after every customer I feel very safe eating there.
510,r2JZDGWoGNweOww6VZNSNA,5,"The food is reasonably priced and very good ,wide selection of food which is rare in this time of Covid 19."
510,r2JZDGWoGNweOww6VZNSNA,5,Service is also very good no complaints whatsoever.
511,maXCVQZtyZG0AfmBeYejyg,1,Was in the North Charleston BurgerPalace a few months ago.
511,maXCVQZtyZG0AfmBeYejyg,1,All I will say about the visit is I watched an employee wipe down the salad bar and threw everything on the floor and didn't bother to clean it up and walked away.
511,maXCVQZtyZG0AfmBeYejyg,1,I will never ever ever go to BurgerPalace again after seeing that.
511,maXCVQZtyZG0AfmBeYejyg,1,That Has to be a health violation.
511,maXCVQZtyZG0AfmBeYejyg,1,If you are thinking about going to this BurgerPalace don't just don't.
512,jDEE-amP8AJ9H_LrAgl6gw,1,"Oh man, where to start."
512,jDEE-amP8AJ9H_LrAgl6gw,1,"BurgerPalace used to be pretty good about a decade ago, but times have changed."
512,jDEE-amP8AJ9H_LrAgl6gw,1,The place was so under staffed they could only have maybe 10 tables out of 40 or so open at one time.
512,jDEE-amP8AJ9H_LrAgl6gw,1,"There were two waitresses for the entire place, and I don't think there was anyone designated to bus the tables because empty tables stayed dirty the entire time we were there."
512,jDEE-amP8AJ9H_LrAgl6gw,1,"I'm not sure who was washing dishes, but we ordered our water and they came in dirty cups."
512,jDEE-amP8AJ9H_LrAgl6gw,1,"We asked for different glasses of water, because the grime on the inside of the cup wiped away with a finger swipe and I didn't want my kids drinking out of dirty cups."
512,jDEE-amP8AJ9H_LrAgl6gw,1,We get our new glasses of water and those cups were dirty as well.
512,jDEE-amP8AJ9H_LrAgl6gw,1,"After asking for clean glasses our waitress didn't come back to our table for a while, which is fine as there were literally only two of them, but it did feel a little personal."
512,jDEE-amP8AJ9H_LrAgl6gw,1,"We finally got to order our food, and my husband ordered the Triple Play Platter with ribs, shrimp, and chicken ($22 bucks)...the portions of this plate were...disappointing and definitely not worth 22 dollars."
512,jDEE-amP8AJ9H_LrAgl6gw,1,The rest of the food was mediocre.
512,jDEE-amP8AJ9H_LrAgl6gw,1,"We did tip our waitress because regardless of my feelings towards the cleanliness and food portions, she did bust her tail and was friendly."
512,jDEE-amP8AJ9H_LrAgl6gw,1,We will not return.
513,P7pkB7qWX_kBljRd_OEWkg,4,We had a wonderful meal at this BurgerPalace We enjoyed their salad bar though a bit small they were quick to refill the bar and replenish any toppings that were gone.
513,P7pkB7qWX_kBljRd_OEWkg,4,Their loaded fries were amazing!
513,P7pkB7qWX_kBljRd_OEWkg,4,We got cheesecake to go and throughly enjoyed the friendly service and kindness of our hostess.
514,V38MImP_Nivg4jzroDWzCw,1,"Seven shrimp, one baked potato $17.49 is absolutely ridiculous!!"
514,V38MImP_Nivg4jzroDWzCw,1,"While ordering was told to choose two sides minutes later the waitress comes back to the table and says there had been a change ""mid day "" and my meal only came with one side."
514,V38MImP_Nivg4jzroDWzCw,1,No change to the price!
514,V38MImP_Nivg4jzroDWzCw,1,Manager came over said I'm sorry and agreed it was ridiculous but couldn't do anything about it.
514,V38MImP_Nivg4jzroDWzCw,1,"While leaving a woman comes in with a small dog on a leash ""no it was not a service dog ""."
514,V38MImP_Nivg4jzroDWzCw,1,First and last time I eat there.
514,V38MImP_Nivg4jzroDWzCw,1,I now know why BurgerPalace is becoming a thing of the past.
515,aHSUT7uSg_rsn4-5nRyBKw,1,Eaten at plenty of BurgerPalace this one is a sh*t hole.
515,aHSUT7uSg_rsn4-5nRyBKw,1,No way to sugar coat it.
515,aHSUT7uSg_rsn4-5nRyBKw,1,"""Menu change in the middle of the day"" which included no longer getting 2 sides with the meal but the price being the same."
515,aHSUT7uSg_rsn4-5nRyBKw,1,The staff was unprofessional and looked thrown away (manager included).
515,aHSUT7uSg_rsn4-5nRyBKw,1,"The food, decent at best."
515,aHSUT7uSg_rsn4-5nRyBKw,1,Mashed potatoes were cold.
515,aHSUT7uSg_rsn4-5nRyBKw,1,There is a reason so many of these places keep going out of business and this one is a prime example.
515,aHSUT7uSg_rsn4-5nRyBKw,1,"Side note: As we were leaving a woman walks in with her dog on a leash, not a service dog."
515,aHSUT7uSg_rsn4-5nRyBKw,1,Just a regular little nappy chihuahua.
516,phYlZqZMJIZvFaidRaZ7Qg,5,I really wish I took a picture of our food!!!!
516,phYlZqZMJIZvFaidRaZ7Qg,5,We walked in a hour before close and really expected really quick and horrible service.
516,phYlZqZMJIZvFaidRaZ7Qg,5,"AmariRay, Crystal and Myra are employees to make a change."
516,phYlZqZMJIZvFaidRaZ7Qg,5,They are a awesome group of individuals also the cook.
516,phYlZqZMJIZvFaidRaZ7Qg,5,Although we came in late we was served and tended to as if we came in early.

516,phYlZqZMJIZvFaidRaZ7Qg,5,See you all soon!!
517,LvB2qv8sJfBmSAecxeKl4g,1,the management was not very nice while we were there.
517,LvB2qv8sJfBmSAecxeKl4g,1,They made us wait 20 minutes just to come an tell us that what we ordered was not on the menu today.
517,LvB2qv8sJfBmSAecxeKl4g,1,It created a very uncomfortable situation for my family and friends on my birthday.
517,LvB2qv8sJfBmSAecxeKl4g,1,I wouldn't suggest taking your FAMILY here if you want it to be special.
518,bY4zTsHpJSNh1GIEv0E1Lg,1,If i could give it a big fat Zero I would .
518,bY4zTsHpJSNh1GIEv0E1Lg,1,Literally the worst and most disgusting place I have ever been to in my life .
518,bY4zTsHpJSNh1GIEv0E1Lg,1,Please don't go here .
518,bY4zTsHpJSNh1GIEv0E1Lg,1,Omg never bring your children here .
518,bY4zTsHpJSNh1GIEv0E1Lg,1,So dirty !
518,bY4zTsHpJSNh1GIEv0E1Lg,1,The food is gross and the people that work here are covered with food and stains on their clothes and they are so unfriendly.
518,bY4zTsHpJSNh1GIEv0E1Lg,1,The salad bar is horrendous! .
518,bY4zTsHpJSNh1GIEv0E1Lg,1,Can't say enough about how awful this place is !!
519,fRWWzn1Nb_1NDitBp40G0Q,4,I called prior to my arrival to inquire about the weight and was told about 20 minutes.
519,fRWWzn1Nb_1NDitBp40G0Q,4,I arrived ten minutes later to be told it's still 20 minutes but after a few was immediately sat in the bar area since there was no one sitting at the bar.
519,fRWWzn1Nb_1NDitBp40G0Q,4,The waiter was very cordial and he provided our initial drinks fairly quickly.
519,fRWWzn1Nb_1NDitBp40G0Q,4,He came back several times because it took us a little longer to order.
519,fRWWzn1Nb_1NDitBp40G0Q,4,Once the food was ordered we went and help yourself to the salad bar.
519,fRWWzn1Nb_1NDitBp40G0Q,4,They are usually known for their salad bar and for the most part it was pretty decent but there were several things that they were out of an obviously were in no rush to replace since I or entire trip they didn't replace things like the signature croutons among other things.
519,fRWWzn1Nb_1NDitBp40G0Q,4,What are food arrived we had one minor set back which I was able to get corrected.
519,fRWWzn1Nb_1NDitBp40G0Q,4,My big issue was constantly having to tell the waiter to fill a bar drinks even after bringing stuff to the table and seeing the cups completely empty.
519,fRWWzn1Nb_1NDitBp40G0Q,4,Yes that is a huge pet peeve for me to have to ask to have my drinks refilled since when they are in a completely observable area and are to the bottom empty it should be an expectation for them to be filled.
519,fRWWzn1Nb_1NDitBp40G0Q,4,Several times I had to find him and let him know we needed something to drink.
519,fRWWzn1Nb_1NDitBp40G0Q,4,Other than that the food was pretty decent and the visit was mostly uneventful.
520,S0qyAt8AXw7AlCGvwuKJdA,4,Update from last review:   Things were much better this time around.
520,S0qyAt8AXw7AlCGvwuKJdA,4,The food tasted better though once again it was thrown on the plate with no real care.
520,S0qyAt8AXw7AlCGvwuKJdA,4,To me presentation is what fuels my appetite....but I digress....
520,S0qyAt8AXw7AlCGvwuKJdA,4,The BurgerPalace Relaxer was pretty good.
520,S0qyAt8AXw7AlCGvwuKJdA,4,The salad bar once again saved the day.
520,S0qyAt8AXw7AlCGvwuKJdA,4,Steak was prepared as asked.
520,S0qyAt8AXw7AlCGvwuKJdA,4,Our server was visibly overworked but she was very nice and attentive regardless.
520,S0qyAt8AXw7AlCGvwuKJdA,4,Overall I'm pleased
521,_ilvjw1vpES2abSFl9BEDg,1,This was probably the dirtiest restaurant I've been to in a loooong time.
521,_ilvjw1vpES2abSFl9BEDg,1,Someone had a period mess all over the bathroom and it made me want to RUN but we had already ordered.
521,_ilvjw1vpES2abSFl9BEDg,1,The salad bar sounded good but was out of plates and also out of almost everything ....not well stocked.
521,_ilvjw1vpES2abSFl9BEDg,1,Standing in line at the  salad bar there was a sticky invisible mess on the carpet.
521,_ilvjw1vpES2abSFl9BEDg,1,It was disgusting.
521,_ilvjw1vpES2abSFl9BEDg,1,They need a health inspector and a deep cleaning.
521,_ilvjw1vpES2abSFl9BEDg,1,If they can't then they need to close up shop  for a while to reset or just throw in the towel.
522,BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,This just may have been our worst restaurant experience ever.
522,BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,"To start, the first worker we encountered ignored us as we walked in, walked past us multiple times without saying a word to us and left us waiting at the door to be seated for about 5 minutes in a mostly empty restaurant."
522,BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,Another waitress came over and sat us at our table.
522,BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,"The table was sticky and dirty, high chair had food crusted on it and broken snaps and the booth seat was collapsed."
522,BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,"Against our better judgement, we ordered the salad bar with our food."
522,BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,"It was under stocked, not fresh and what was had the tongs/spoons laying in the food, handle and all."
522,BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,"They seemed understaffed and our young waitress was juggling multiple tables and greeting guests, it took a little time to get her attention for silverware."
522,BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,"About 10 minutes after ordering, we heard the kitchen call order up."
522,BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,"The middle aged waitress went to the kitchen, came out looking at us and then just stood there not taking out food to anyone."
522,BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,"After quite a bit of time, our food was brought out cold, mushy and absolutely disgusting."
522,BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,The bbq nachos was topped with what looked like American cheese sliced that cooled into a plastic like texture.
522,BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,The chicken was puverized into a sauce that looked like vomit.
522,BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,"My husband's Philly cheesesteak hoagie was cooked on a dirty griddle, we both spit out our first bite and it was covered in burnt black speckles."
522,BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,The bathrooms were the worst ever encountered in a restaurant.
522,BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,"The women's had poop smeared on one of the seats, the other yellow drips down the side."
522,BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1, Piss on the floor and toilet paper strewn about - it is clear it had not been cleaned in many business days.
522,BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,"Customer service, poor."
522,BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,"Food, disgusting."
522,BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,"Establishment, a disaster."
522,BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,I've been to many BurgerPalace - this is an embarrassment to the brand.
523,Kiyr9wX_AAxJKGs2gSPg3w,1,The food was horrible tonight.
523,Kiyr9wX_AAxJKGs2gSPg3w,1, 
523,Kiyr9wX_AAxJKGs2gSPg3w,1,Got 2 sirloins.
523,Kiyr9wX_AAxJKGs2gSPg3w,1,One was to have been cook medium and was well done.
523,Kiyr9wX_AAxJKGs2gSPg3w,1, The other was to have been well done and was charred on the outside and raw inside.
523,Kiyr9wX_AAxJKGs2gSPg3w,1, The kids chicken tenders were left in the fryer 2 minutes too long.
523,Kiyr9wX_AAxJKGs2gSPg3w,1,  Salad bar was good except the ice berg lettuce was brown on edges.
523,Kiyr9wX_AAxJKGs2gSPg3w,1, Waitress was at our table 3 times without removing empty salad plates.
523,Kiyr9wX_AAxJKGs2gSPg3w,1, Would not recommend.
523,Kiyr9wX_AAxJKGs2gSPg3w,1, 
523,Kiyr9wX_AAxJKGs2gSPg3w,1,Guess that was why there was no waiting in a Saturday night.
523,Kiyr9wX_AAxJKGs2gSPg3w,1, Lesson learned.
524,-GrnFyd3EqLPpmKA4qv2Kg,2,We stopped here on the way back from vacation.
524,-GrnFyd3EqLPpmKA4qv2Kg,2,Thought a fresh salad bar sounded good.
524,-GrnFyd3EqLPpmKA4qv2Kg,2,This was by far one of the dirtiest restaurants I have been in for a long time.
524,-GrnFyd3EqLPpmKA4qv2Kg,2,"The salad bar was not fresh, but it was stocked."
524,-GrnFyd3EqLPpmKA4qv2Kg,2,There was a film over some of the food showing it hadn't been stirred or changed in a while.
524,-GrnFyd3EqLPpmKA4qv2Kg,2,The waitress did not refrain from telling us they were short staffed.
524,-GrnFyd3EqLPpmKA4qv2Kg,2,Half way through the dinner she said she had enough and locked the door around 8:30.
524,-GrnFyd3EqLPpmKA4qv2Kg,2,I took my son to the restroom and was disturbed by the amount of urine caked in the urinal and unknown substance all over counter.
524,-GrnFyd3EqLPpmKA4qv2Kg,2,It was quite concerning about the cleanliness of the kitchen.
524,-GrnFyd3EqLPpmKA4qv2Kg,2,I posted a picture of a no ice sign.
524,-GrnFyd3EqLPpmKA4qv2Kg,2,I am trying to wrap my head around this.
524,-GrnFyd3EqLPpmKA4qv2Kg,2,Since McDonald's across the lot has bags of ice for $1 and my drinks were served with ice.
524,-GrnFyd3EqLPpmKA4qv2Kg,2,Do they not have an ice machine?
524,-GrnFyd3EqLPpmKA4qv2Kg,2,And this was the only restaurant with a sign on it.
525,KDlFTqApQTM7CgnGSq-8mQ,1,The food took around 35 minutes to come out with almost no one else in the restaurant and with the wrong toppings and sides we ordered the Philly Cheesesteak and the sauce looked like it was left out for a week and was not appetizing at all would NOT recommend!!!
526,4m9QaleMWTti3AULp5ceKw,3,"Had chicken tender dinner tonite, tasted vaguely like shrimp."
526,4m9QaleMWTti3AULp5ceKw,3,I think they probably cook the shrimp and chicken in the same oil.
527,ypzjA7DzeIdN2vt2WItOVA,2,Went in after running into the Edinburg outlet mall.
527,ypzjA7DzeIdN2vt2WItOVA,2,We were pretty hungry so I went in to see the seating and there was plenty of seating available.
527,ypzjA7DzeIdN2vt2WItOVA,2,We were greeted by a waitress who was pretty nice.
527,ypzjA7DzeIdN2vt2WItOVA,2,We finally sat down and started to look around and no one had masks on  per mandate and the posting on the business door.
527,ypzjA7DzeIdN2vt2WItOVA,2,The waitress that greeted us didn't have her mask on appropriately leaving out her nose.
527,ypzjA7DzeIdN2vt2WItOVA,2,The kitchen staff had no mask on at all.
527,ypzjA7DzeIdN2vt2WItOVA,2,We left.
527,ypzjA7DzeIdN2vt2WItOVA,2,Time to go.
527,ypzjA7DzeIdN2vt2WItOVA,2,The additional star was that we were greeted immediately.
528,kaZt28x80GzNoczjovFbig,3,The chips were really stale and water tastes like bleach.
528,kaZt28x80GzNoczjovFbig,3,"Found a hair in my drink, and the restroom sewage system is very loud and obnoxious."
528,kaZt28x80GzNoczjovFbig,3,Dirty plates and dirty silverware.
528,kaZt28x80GzNoczjovFbig,3,"The waitress was very nice and helpful, best one I have had in a while."
528,kaZt28x80GzNoczjovFbig,3,Best part about the whole lunch was the pineapple upside down cake.
529,IOiIsN_cWWegQtlv4AKz0Q,1,I work at the mall next to this location.
529,IOiIsN_cWWegQtlv4AKz0Q,1,I thought the salad bar to go would be a nice lunch.
529,IOiIsN_cWWegQtlv4AKz0Q,1,I purchased the soup and salad bar to go.
529,IOiIsN_cWWegQtlv4AKz0Q,1,"After paying, I was give my box for the salad bar."
529,IOiIsN_cWWegQtlv4AKz0Q,1,"I walk over I there was no lettuce, and half the toppings were empty."
529,IOiIsN_cWWegQtlv4AKz0Q,1,I paid almost $15 for this.
529,IOiIsN_cWWegQtlv4AKz0Q,1," $17 with a tip6 waitresses were working, less then 10 tables were occupied."
529,IOiIsN_cWWegQtlv4AKz0Q,1,One of the customers I heard asking to see a manager.
529,IOiIsN_cWWegQtlv4AKz0Q,1,I heard one waitress asking were a plate was because her table had be waiting 39mins!
529,IOiIsN_cWWegQtlv4AKz0Q,1,Holy moly
529,IOiIsN_cWWegQtlv4AKz0Q,1,.
529,IOiIsN_cWWegQtlv4AKz0Q,1,This place is definitely Not manned by motivated individuals.
529,IOiIsN_cWWegQtlv4AKz0Q,1,I will not recommend any of my customers to have lunch at this location.
530,aGGKb37mbjsMceK5q1MIeQ,4,Delicious garden salad buffet makes a lovely Saturday afternoon break for lunch while shopping the outlet mall.
530,aGGKb37mbjsMceK5q1MIeQ,4,"Must try the mango ice tea, yummy."
531,bvxnygqSPWfS2StOmTLRJw,3,"So the food is good, really good."
531,bvxnygqSPWfS2StOmTLRJw,3,The service that's where it gets bad.
531,bvxnygqSPWfS2StOmTLRJw,3,The dude who took my wife and I order was something else.
531,bvxnygqSPWfS2StOmTLRJw,3,He came out like twice while we were there.
531,bvxnygqSPWfS2StOmTLRJw,3,Slacked in the drink department.
531,bvxnygqSPWfS2StOmTLRJw,3,Our total was 50.66 we gave him 3 20s and he asked if we wanted change.
531,bvxnygqSPWfS2StOmTLRJw,3,Don't ask that wow lol.
531,bvxnygqSPWfS2StOmTLRJw,3,Then comes back comes back 9 ones.
531,bvxnygqSPWfS2StOmTLRJw,3,I know it's 44 cent but he pocketed without saying a word.
531,bvxnygqSPWfS2StOmTLRJw,3,Also when we got the boxes and stuff he was standing over us waiting for us to pack them.
531,bvxnygqSPWfS2StOmTLRJw,3,Faking doing things on his handheld thing.
532,1c5oq5h7u5J0MQmJkhg2GQ,3,Was very  pleased with the gluten free Alpine Burger.
532,1c5oq5h7u5J0MQmJkhg2GQ,3,"To get a good tasting gluten free bun is so hard and it was AMAZING, and cooked Medium rare to make me happy."
532,1c5oq5h7u5J0MQmJkhg2GQ,3,I truly enjoyed my food.
532,1c5oq5h7u5J0MQmJkhg2GQ,3,The service was not so good and the manager was rude.
532,1c5oq5h7u5J0MQmJkhg2GQ,3,Because she didn't want to deal with me she comp'd our entire meal which wasn't necessary (the meal they forgot to bring was though).
532,1c5oq5h7u5J0MQmJkhg2GQ,3,"Place wasn't busy, we did have a large party (a team) but we weren't hard to serve, this should have been easier to handle!"
532,1c5oq5h7u5J0MQmJkhg2GQ,3,Will go back to BurgerPalace just not to this location or with a large party!
532,1c5oq5h7u5J0MQmJkhg2GQ,3,Happy I have leftovers though!
533,7Er4HbVH_2KNYfCr4_zfqg,2,I do not eat much neither does my older mother so we usually share a meal.
533,7Er4HbVH_2KNYfCr4_zfqg,2,But BurgerPalace has this special running 2 for $22.
533,7Er4HbVH_2KNYfCr4_zfqg,2,So we decided to try it.
533,7Er4HbVH_2KNYfCr4_zfqg,2,Well when the bill came there was an added $12 to the bill that was unknown to us.
533,7Er4HbVH_2KNYfCr4_zfqg,2,When asked it was additional charges.
533,7Er4HbVH_2KNYfCr4_zfqg,2,Apparently not everything advertised as 3 for $22 is it's actually 2 for $34 when the bill comes so be aware pricing is not what it's advertised and no one will tell you!
533,7Er4HbVH_2KNYfCr4_zfqg,2,The food was good and the waitress nice but we would not have ordered those meals if we were not deceived on pricing.
534,5UHHowxufAOwsf_aoK5hGw,1,"The quality of this particular BurgerPalace has gone from bad to worse, , today we came in and was told the wait would be 15 to 20 minutes due to a large party of 15 as they had reservations, but to wait when half the restaurant had vacant tables."
534,5UHHowxufAOwsf_aoK5hGw,1,If we waited the service would have been so bad because all the attention with a small Staff would have been a two hour meal .
534,5UHHowxufAOwsf_aoK5hGw,1,"The chef was on his cell phone, and some servers were just standing doing nothing."
534,5UHHowxufAOwsf_aoK5hGw,1,Total unorganized management.
534,5UHHowxufAOwsf_aoK5hGw,1,Someone needs to be fired .
534,5UHHowxufAOwsf_aoK5hGw,1,"If you can't handle a party of 15 , you need to close down ."
534,5UHHowxufAOwsf_aoK5hGw,1,We went to the Villages location and was seated immediately.
535,H7S0qV9j9rP336-11qIR1w,1,If I could leave less than one star I would.
535,H7S0qV9j9rP336-11qIR1w,1,"I ate in the bar area one night and waited and waited and the Bartender refused to take my order, I guess it wasn't HER job."
535,H7S0qV9j9rP336-11qIR1w,1,So I got up and went to the BurgerPalace in the Villages and Always get great service there
536,0VWkrlmP3mJf2Ed-rWLIqQ,2,"I placed a take-out order for a plain hamburger with no cheese, cooked medium."
536,0VWkrlmP3mJf2Ed-rWLIqQ,2,"I got a cheeseburger, cooked rare."
536,0VWkrlmP3mJf2Ed-rWLIqQ,2,Wha??
537,hrRZpOA-kHroSeEmzvnbXQ,4,"Ordered delivery food, a steak with mashed potatoes and salad."
537,hrRZpOA-kHroSeEmzvnbXQ,4, The mashed and salad were only average but OK.
537,hrRZpOA-kHroSeEmzvnbXQ,4, But the steak was excellent.
537,hrRZpOA-kHroSeEmzvnbXQ,4,"It was only a sirloin, not an expensive cut, but it was perfectly prepared, truly rare just as I'd ordered it, and very tender."
537,hrRZpOA-kHroSeEmzvnbXQ,4, I was really in the mood for a steak and I was so glad to get a good one.
537,hrRZpOA-kHroSeEmzvnbXQ,4," Also, I was pleased at the way it looked."
537,hrRZpOA-kHroSeEmzvnbXQ,4," Sometimes cooks will just throw delivery food into the takeout containers, but tho not fancy this was neat and nicely presented."
537,hrRZpOA-kHroSeEmzvnbXQ,4," All in all, very satisfied and glad I decided to order from them."
537,hrRZpOA-kHroSeEmzvnbXQ,4, I will definitely order again.
537,hrRZpOA-kHroSeEmzvnbXQ,4, 
537,hrRZpOA-kHroSeEmzvnbXQ,4,"Thanks, guys."
538,PQDveb2XMd6aTTFCb6wOtQ,3,"Had low expectations at this place that borders a dying shopping mall, but we were traveling and hungry."
538,PQDveb2XMd6aTTFCb6wOtQ,3,The salad bar is the thing at BurgerPalace but don't confuse that with cheap.
538,PQDveb2XMd6aTTFCb6wOtQ,3,"I got the tilapia, which is often tasty at mid-range chain restaurants, and it didn't disappoint, but the parmesan cream sauce drowned the flavor."
538,PQDveb2XMd6aTTFCb6wOtQ,3,"My hubby got the crispy chicken sandwich, and said it was OK."
538,PQDveb2XMd6aTTFCb6wOtQ,3,What's a crying shame is that an average lunch cost $44 and change.
539,PNqH2HCuZmJKlPGYZmxfhg,1,"Food was over salted, small portions for price!"
539,PNqH2HCuZmJKlPGYZmxfhg,1,Everything was poor except the server.
539,PNqH2HCuZmJKlPGYZmxfhg,1,Won't be going there again.
539,PNqH2HCuZmJKlPGYZmxfhg,1,Not at all what it used to be!
540,LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1,"I reviewed this restaurant about a year ago, and it was two stars.  Several weeks ago, my wife and I decided to try it again."
540,LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1," This time, one star and I doubt we will ever return."
540,LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1,"First, I would like to say the young lady that was our waitress was as good as any we've had anywhere."
540,LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1," That's your single star, BurgerPalace bad:  YOU NEED A TRAINED MANAGER!"
540,LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1, This location had a bunch of young kids hanging around the entrance to greet and seat you.
540,LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1, Too bad they had no instructions as to how to do their job.  One of them was also cleaning tables.
540,LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1," Too bad no one trained him to get all the slop off the tables:  yes, my side of the table was not wiped cleaned."
540,LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1, Opening the napkin wrapped silverware show a fork that was not clean.
540,LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1, We had burgers.
540,LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1, My wife's was as she ordered.
540,LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1," Mine was great, but only as a shoe sole!"
540,LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1,  Grossly overcooked.
540,LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1,Why does this chain think they can operate without a trained manager?
540,LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1," Why do they think they need 4 or 5 high school kids milling around, where 2 trained people could the job."
540,LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1," I forgot to add how the restrooms could use attention, again, where's the manager."
540,LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1," As this seems to be the constant condition of this restaurant, the chain must feel this is acceptable."
540,LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1, Maybe they should hire a few secret diners to visit their restaurants at random times?
541,7pqm4GW0P5yX-wNl9K0-ag,1,"Health Inspector, are you listening?"
541,7pqm4GW0P5yX-wNl9K0-ag,1,This place is downright disgusting.
541,7pqm4GW0P5yX-wNl9K0-ag,1,It just feels dirty when you walk in.
541,7pqm4GW0P5yX-wNl9K0-ag,1,"There were flies everywhere, including all over the buffet."
541,7pqm4GW0P5yX-wNl9K0-ag,1,The bathrooms clearly haven't been cleaned in a while.
541,7pqm4GW0P5yX-wNl9K0-ag,1,"Slow, lazy staff."
541,7pqm4GW0P5yX-wNl9K0-ag,1,"Food was dried out, minuscule portions, and just badly presented."
541,7pqm4GW0P5yX-wNl9K0-ag,1,"We had no silverware, our drinks got refilled, never took dirty plates off the table."
541,7pqm4GW0P5yX-wNl9K0-ag,1,Server only showed up to collect her tip.
541,7pqm4GW0P5yX-wNl9K0-ag,1,"If a group of 20-somethings who never worked a job in their lives before decided to open a restaurant on a whim one day, this is what I imagine it would be like."
541,7pqm4GW0P5yX-wNl9K0-ag,1,There are so many other great restaurants nearby.
541,7pqm4GW0P5yX-wNl9K0-ag,1,I can't imagine this one will be in business much longer.
542,1idpNyydPbsSfVDiPCDmbA,1,Would love to leave a good review but of course I didn't get most of my order again.
542,1idpNyydPbsSfVDiPCDmbA,1,"I'm usually missing at least one thing but today my order came and I was missing a cheeseburger, grilled zucchini, and 2 kids drinks."
542,1idpNyydPbsSfVDiPCDmbA,1,Had delivered through DoorDash.
542,1idpNyydPbsSfVDiPCDmbA,1,So I didn't get to have dinner and the kids didn't get their drinks
543,MAnlwqzhAEGiwIR6B0GpTg,2,"Ordered the chicken fresco and shrimp fajitas, added 2 salad bars."
543,MAnlwqzhAEGiwIR6B0GpTg,2,"No drink refills offered and out food took an hur even though there was only 3 tables in the sectiin,6 tables in the whole place."
543,MAnlwqzhAEGiwIR6B0GpTg,2,Waiter was friendly but the kitchen was super slow.
543,MAnlwqzhAEGiwIR6B0GpTg,2,Food was average at best and we were given some excuse about shrimp taking a long time to cook.
544,QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,The food isn't that great.
544,QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,I've been to one other BurgerPalace in Harrisburg that I wasn't impressed with and this one followed suit.
544,QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,I had the cheddar broccoli soup and the broccoli was half raw.
544,QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,Needed cooked longer.
544,QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,I can handle al dente to a point but spare me crunchy vegetables in soup.
544,QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,"Panera has them beat hands down with their broccoli cheddar  soup, too bad there isn't one nearby."
544,QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,The baked potato was ok but it takes a lot to screw up a baked potato.
544,QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,The salad bar was very basic without much fanfare.
544,QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,The smoked ham cut in little cubes was way too smokey tasting.
544,QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,Overall the food deserved two stars but there is no way to break the rating down.
544,QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,"The service was five stars, again, no way to break it down."
544,QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,But in the end the place is only deserving of one star because you take your health into your own hands going inside.
544,QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,We're in the middle of a pandemic.
544,QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,Covid cases in Clearfield county continue to rise and so does the death toll.
544,QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,"I realize this is DuBois Pennsylvania and the politics of the region play into the whole ""I have my rights"" dialog, and people do, but not when they interfere with my rights."
544,QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,Why have a sign on the door of the restaurant saying masks are required when you are seating people who come in without wearing masks?
544,QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,You don't even ask them to put one on.
544,QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,"Add a sentence at the bottom off the sign that says ""NOTE: WE DO NOT ENFORCE THIS MASK RULE"" so that I can make an informed decision whether or not I want to expose myself to covid from people walking in past my table without wearing a mask."
544,QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,This is not an outdoor restaurant.
544,QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,I left before I could see if the people who were seated without masks went up to the salad bar not wearing them.
544,QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,I don't have to really guess if they did or didn't.
544,QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,"So if you feel you're immune from covid and are put off by wearing a mask then here's a place for you altho frankly, even without the pandemic, the food alone wouldn't have me coming back."
544,QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,"But most importantly, if you're not going to enforce the rule you state on the entrance door then you need to either take the mask sign down all together or include a statement that you're not enforcing the rule so people like me have the option of turning around and going back to their car."
544,QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,That is not asking much.
545,ZRE0uja6-E-k4ZouA2XvnQ,1,In Pennsylvania our bars are closed and one has to order a meal in order to consume alcohol.
545,ZRE0uja6-E-k4ZouA2XvnQ,1,I guess this edict doesn't apply to BurgerPalace This past week a man stood at the bar with his mask around his chin ordering double shots of Jack Daniels.
545,ZRE0uja6-E-k4ZouA2XvnQ,1,"He drank four double shots, and two other drinks and was coughing up a storm."
545,ZRE0uja6-E-k4ZouA2XvnQ,1,"The bartender kept pouring, he kept drinking and coughing."
546,VQNXma0uddb_hXcLnI3NQQ,2,"ok, i did give them two stars AND a recommendation but only because of the salad bar."
546,VQNXma0uddb_hXcLnI3NQQ,2,the staff seems to be working hard to keep things afloat but the salad bar is not refilled and looks messy.
546,VQNXma0uddb_hXcLnI3NQQ,2,"why did i say the salad was the reason for my recommendation , well it is a good salad if that's the meal you seek and it just takes me back to when the ruby was cool."
547,K052Sde30Y_buqwTDWyBqA,5,We had to wait a good while for a table for 8.
547,K052Sde30Y_buqwTDWyBqA,5,"However, the bar tender made a wonderful drink and I needed it."
547,K052Sde30Y_buqwTDWyBqA,5,"If you ever go, ask for David as your server."
547,K052Sde30Y_buqwTDWyBqA,5,He was awesome.
547,K052Sde30Y_buqwTDWyBqA,5,"David turned our night around after a long wait, with his commentary, energy, and service to our large party."
547,K052Sde30Y_buqwTDWyBqA,5,He made it a 10/10 dining experience.
547,K052Sde30Y_buqwTDWyBqA,5,Thank you so much David!!!
548,Okg4EBGdzRW-LOOQ2jRNGw,1,Ordered take out and absolutely ridiculous.
548,Okg4EBGdzRW-LOOQ2jRNGw,1,Did not have Mac and Cheese as a side.
548,Okg4EBGdzRW-LOOQ2jRNGw,1,One entree had the sides plus a side for a different entree.
548,Okg4EBGdzRW-LOOQ2jRNGw,1,But the absolute worst was I ordered a Loaded Baked Potato and I got a cooked potato not cut no butter nothing.
549,JhnJFUxcJ072S84yLqn5BA,1,Would not return.
549,JhnJFUxcJ072S84yLqn5BA,1,Place looked overall dirty.
549,JhnJFUxcJ072S84yLqn5BA,1,Table was sticky and the wall looked the same.
549,JhnJFUxcJ072S84yLqn5BA,1,Salad bar looked like food poisoning.
549,JhnJFUxcJ072S84yLqn5BA,1,I'd be surprised if the server wasn't high.
549,JhnJFUxcJ072S84yLqn5BA,1,My first drink came in a dirty glass with salt questionably applied to the rim.
549,JhnJFUxcJ072S84yLqn5BA,1,I'm not sure what the deal was with the second drink.
549,JhnJFUxcJ072S84yLqn5BA,1,Was disgusting.
549,JhnJFUxcJ072S84yLqn5BA,1,The food was OK.
549,JhnJFUxcJ072S84yLqn5BA,1,"Only stopped here on the way to the airport, but wanting to share my experience with others."
550,M91YWbCZA48L_LenSkxYGg,1,Wow.
550,M91YWbCZA48L_LenSkxYGg,1,This is the first restaurant in Jackson that was HORRIBLE and I'm sorry we stopped.
550,M91YWbCZA48L_LenSkxYGg,1,"Upon entering, the young hostess came to the podium with her mouth full and with an attitude."
550,M91YWbCZA48L_LenSkxYGg,1,Okk.
550,M91YWbCZA48L_LenSkxYGg,1,I asked her if she was ok and she said she was eating and working because they don't get breaks.
550,M91YWbCZA48L_LenSkxYGg,1,"Again, should have left to go somewhere else, but we didn't because we were hungry."
550,M91YWbCZA48L_LenSkxYGg,1,Gabby was our server- she was nice.
550,M91YWbCZA48L_LenSkxYGg,1,We ordered 3 different things- 2 out of 3 were terrible.
550,M91YWbCZA48L_LenSkxYGg,1,"We didn't let a Manager know because after getting turned down for a drink because they were closing... it was like, ""what's the point !"""
550,M91YWbCZA48L_LenSkxYGg,1,Yelp has their hours closing at 11pBut
550,M91YWbCZA48L_LenSkxYGg,1,they actually close at 10.
550,M91YWbCZA48L_LenSkxYGg,1,We had just received our food when the hostess asked if we wanted a to go box.
550,M91YWbCZA48L_LenSkxYGg,1,So rude!
550,M91YWbCZA48L_LenSkxYGg,1,I don't have anything positive to say because the food and service was not up to par.
551,XNWyh5FyYUrfViE8zeu1Gw,1,Would not recommend.
551,XNWyh5FyYUrfViE8zeu1Gw,1,Upon entering the salad bar looks like a buffet that wasn't cleaned up after a party...
551,XNWyh5FyYUrfViE8zeu1Gw,1,my booth  bench was dirty as was the window sill (like food particles & dirt!!) service was slow then when my drink came the cup was dirty.
551,XNWyh5FyYUrfViE8zeu1Gw,1,Lastly they were out of fries & onion rings and when asked if I could add sweet potato fries at no extra cost (since they were out of fries & onion rings ) Iwas told they would have to charge me extra anyways.
551,XNWyh5FyYUrfViE8zeu1Gw,1,We cancelled our food paid for my husbands beer & just ate at home.
551,XNWyh5FyYUrfViE8zeu1Gw,1,So sad truly
552,dnChIsmjuOpLkT6pPmgCkA,3,"Man, im actually disappointed today."
552,dnChIsmjuOpLkT6pPmgCkA,3,So much so to take the time to leave a review .
552,dnChIsmjuOpLkT6pPmgCkA,3,Normally ruby hits every time.
552,dnChIsmjuOpLkT6pPmgCkA,3,I normally get the same thing but today i decided to try something different and to also use a food delivery app.
552,dnChIsmjuOpLkT6pPmgCkA,3,NOTHING against the delivery person.
552,dnChIsmjuOpLkT6pPmgCkA,3,So much so that the food came quick and hot.
552,dnChIsmjuOpLkT6pPmgCkA,3,"The chicken today wasn't seasoned so much the sides tho, really the sides was the main inspo for the review."
552,dnChIsmjuOpLkT6pPmgCkA,3,I ordered loaded baked potato and these folks sent me fries with that canned cheese on top  cmon now ruby .
552,dnChIsmjuOpLkT6pPmgCkA,3,Imma write this review but imma still fw yall tho
553,P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,"If I could give 0 stars, I would."
553,P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,"First, the server did not speak or tell her name (still don't know her name but if I did, I would tell you)."
553,P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,"When we ordered anything and said thank you, she would not reply."
553,P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,Just rude for no reason.
553,P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,"We placed our order, and she never came back."
553,P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,"When she finally brought out the food, she didn't bring my sister's food and stated that they did not have the Alfredo for her pasta."
553,P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,So I was like why bring out half the food and not tell us earlier that her meal was unavailable?
553,P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,"So, my sister re-ordered after I had to run her down."
553,P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,"I, also, asked for a manager."
553,P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,No manager or re-ordered food ever came.
553,P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,Keep in mind that I'm not eating my food until my sister's comes.
553,P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,"I finally asked another waiter for the manager, and when he did come, he said that it wasn't that they didn't have Alfredo but that the order was put in wrong."
553,P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,So the server lied.
553,P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,He also tried to defend her as if she was so busy but the restaurant was not busy at all!!!
553,P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,"Instead of owning the mistakes made, even when we told him how she never came back to check on us or refill drinks."
553,P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,So by then my sister is mad and asked for our ticket for just the food we had.
553,P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,"She didn't want the re-order, she just wanted to pay and leave because we were not out for free meals like he offered."
553,P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,"I, myself, know the steps you take when you screw up on an order, since I had been a server for 8 years."
553,P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,They still sent out the re-ordered in a Togo box by the 2nd server and brought me a Togo as well since I didn't eat without my sister's food.
553,P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,"Our server and  the manager never came back to our table to apologize or give us the check, so we left hungry minus the app we shared."
553,P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,I know this restaurant will not miss our money but they will NOT see it or our serve again!!!!
553,P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,"I felt like we were treated with no respect, as if we had did something wrong."
553,P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,We were not rude in any shape or form but were treated as if we were the ones who acted as such!!
554,e16GtmNbtUzhwIBNx5xJcA,1,Nobody is taking any pride in this establishment.
554,e16GtmNbtUzhwIBNx5xJcA,1,The place was nearly empty.
554,e16GtmNbtUzhwIBNx5xJcA,1,It was dirty.
554,e16GtmNbtUzhwIBNx5xJcA,1,It looked like it could use a good deep cleaning.
554,e16GtmNbtUzhwIBNx5xJcA,1,It was just dingy and drab.
554,e16GtmNbtUzhwIBNx5xJcA,1,The plates on the salad bar were dirty and the broccoli had mold on it.
554,e16GtmNbtUzhwIBNx5xJcA,1,Our food was food.
554,e16GtmNbtUzhwIBNx5xJcA,1,That's all I can say.
554,e16GtmNbtUzhwIBNx5xJcA,1,It wasn't great.
554,e16GtmNbtUzhwIBNx5xJcA,1,I wouldn't even call it good.
554,e16GtmNbtUzhwIBNx5xJcA,1,The manager was more interested in chatting with the waitresses than working.
554,e16GtmNbtUzhwIBNx5xJcA,1,There were several employees there but Adrianna was the only one that was working.
554,e16GtmNbtUzhwIBNx5xJcA,1,She was friendly and appeared to be hard working.
555,Z6ZOeRpPMoR2JEs8e2Il1Q,1,Service was terrible.
555,Z6ZOeRpPMoR2JEs8e2Il1Q,1,Waiting 10 min until we were waited on.
555,Z6ZOeRpPMoR2JEs8e2Il1Q,1,Salad bar had old food on it.
555,Z6ZOeRpPMoR2JEs8e2Il1Q,1,All staff were rude.
555,Z6ZOeRpPMoR2JEs8e2Il1Q,1,When asked for oil at salad bar was just told no by waiter.
555,Z6ZOeRpPMoR2JEs8e2Il1Q,1,Waitress never spoke just wrote order down.
555,Z6ZOeRpPMoR2JEs8e2Il1Q,1,Appears very poorly run.
556,ohYTS6gqWky4bDH5Je9XlQ,3,"Our server, Angie, was very attentive and helpful."
556,ohYTS6gqWky4bDH5Je9XlQ,3, The garden bar was fresh and well stocked.
556,ohYTS6gqWky4bDH5Je9XlQ,3,The problem was with the ribeye I ordered.
556,ohYTS6gqWky4bDH5Je9XlQ,3,"I specified rare, and it came to the table so we'll-done that it was leathery, so I had to send it back.  "
556,ohYTS6gqWky4bDH5Je9XlQ,3,"Second time, it was fine."
557,WfqSoeaTB9KFz0CYsDngHg,1,Don't know what has happened to this restaurant--possibly lack of willing workers.
557,WfqSoeaTB9KFz0CYsDngHg,1,"Noticed a sign outside ""now hiring""."
557,WfqSoeaTB9KFz0CYsDngHg,1,Service was extremely slow.
557,WfqSoeaTB9KFz0CYsDngHg,1,We ordered salad bar and an appetizer with water to drink.
557,WfqSoeaTB9KFz0CYsDngHg,1,Thankful for the salad bar because we waited ~30 minutes for the appetizer.
557,WfqSoeaTB9KFz0CYsDngHg,1,We ordered it without scallions and it was covered so we had to send it back  and waited another 10 minutes for it to come out cold.
557,WfqSoeaTB9KFz0CYsDngHg,1,All very hard to eat while waiting for water refill.
557,WfqSoeaTB9KFz0CYsDngHg,1,The waitress was nice and apologized saying she had to help in the kitchen.
557,WfqSoeaTB9KFz0CYsDngHg,1,Sadly this may be what we have to look forward to from now on.
558,IY35brciNBmPpAyfW02P4Q,1,A couple of weeks ago I placed a to go order and was told it would be ready in 20-25 minutes.
558,IY35brciNBmPpAyfW02P4Q,1,We arrived 30Minutes later and had to wait 15 more minutes on our order to come out.
558,IY35brciNBmPpAyfW02P4Q,1,Food was cold and employee seemed like it was a bother that we were picking up an order.
558,IY35brciNBmPpAyfW02P4Q,1,I know people are human and it could be a one-off so I tried again tonight.
558,IY35brciNBmPpAyfW02P4Q,1,"Placed an order (two entrees) 40Minutes ago and was told 10-25 mins (weird, but okay)."
558,IY35brciNBmPpAyfW02P4Q,1,Arrived at the 25 minute mark and am still sitting here waiting... when I called to check on it the girl said she would check and hung up on me.
558,IY35brciNBmPpAyfW02P4Q,1,Finally 15 more minutes later they bring my food and again act like it is a nuisance someone placed and order..
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,Second time eating at BurgerPalace in a long while.
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,Our past few experiences were not at this particular Tullahoma location so I am not condemning this establishment for what another did.
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,"With that being said, this one was probably the worst."
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,We came in after my sons graduation ceremony.
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,It was around 9:30pm when we strolled on in their doors.
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,"While we had noticed many other restaurants were packed full, this BurgerPalace was no where close."
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,(Hindsight is 20/20).
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,We were quickly seated then told to wait to be seated because they had not yet wiped the table down.
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,"After it had been cleaned, we sat and looked over our menu."
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,"Our waitress got our drink orders and I asked if they seared their steaks-to which the waitress replied, ""I don't know, let me ask."""
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,She came back and said no.
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,"We then proceeded to order: Chicken Broccoli Pasta, Chicken Mac N Cheese, Ribs with Broccoli and Zucchini, Shrimp and Sausage Pasta, and some Chicken and Bacon something or another..."
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,"2 adults, 3 children-"
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,"So, my husband and 1st daughter received their plates first."
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,"Afterwards, we received the cheese sticks my other daughter ordered as her appetizer, my son received his order second, mine third..."
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,yep.
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,Nothing came out for my other daughter.
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,The waitress said she was going to check on my second daughters food and would have it out directly...
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,"Meanwhile, everyone is tasting their food..."
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,no one liked their food except for my son.
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,"My shrimp and sausage meal order was drowned in a heavy grease substance, disgusting."
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,It was not edible and I told the waitress just that.
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,She asked if I would like anything else...
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,I replied no.
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,Everyone had nearly finished their food except my second daughter who had still not received her order.
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,She disappeared and we waited and waited through refills and even asking for a box for my first daughters leftovers...
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,Still no food for my second daughter.
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,Finally we asked where her food was again- and was told she had only ordered cheese sticks.
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,"Um, what?!"
559,P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,Are you friggin' kidding me?
560,rlZC_QYWLWKRdVilQFP2bA,1,I was with a party of 5 on New Years Day.
560,rlZC_QYWLWKRdVilQFP2bA,1,It took an hour before we got any food at all and then it wasn't all ready at once.
560,rlZC_QYWLWKRdVilQFP2bA,1,"2 peoples potatoes came several minutes later, as did the chicken strips."
560,rlZC_QYWLWKRdVilQFP2bA,1,"One child's order of sliders came was slimy...don't know why, but then they remade them and they came out with a tiny sliver of cheddar cheese that wasn't melted."
560,rlZC_QYWLWKRdVilQFP2bA,1,The burgers were way over cooked.
560,rlZC_QYWLWKRdVilQFP2bA,1,One person ordered a medium well steak and it arrived rare.
560,rlZC_QYWLWKRdVilQFP2bA,1,"With the employees scrambling around in the kitchen and close to it, it seemed as though they were without a cook and underlings were trying to get things out anyway."
560,rlZC_QYWLWKRdVilQFP2bA,1,"If there was an actual phone number to complain to an owner I would, but it seems like they're not concerned with customer satisfaction, only making mines."
560,rlZC_QYWLWKRdVilQFP2bA,1,Applebee's is across the street; I'll go there next time.
561,vBEJd8ba-KQ03E-JSC7lZQ,1,Wanted to place a pick up order .
561,vBEJd8ba-KQ03E-JSC7lZQ,1, Was told to wait .
561,vBEJd8ba-KQ03E-JSC7lZQ,1,After 5 minutes I hung up .  Screw these people .  Since new ownership it's garbage
562,JcGkFRYKDqVzb_etNVe8-A,1,PSA:  Stay away from this location!
562,JcGkFRYKDqVzb_etNVe8-A,1,The food was absolutely disgusting!
562,JcGkFRYKDqVzb_etNVe8-A,1," I'm genrally not one to write negative reviews, but this experience is in my top five worst ever."
562,JcGkFRYKDqVzb_etNVe8-A,1,"For lunch today, I had the 6 oz sirloin, with a double order of grilled zucchini."
562,JcGkFRYKDqVzb_etNVe8-A,1," The steak was cooked as ordered, and was OK (at best), but the zucchini tasted really bad."
562,JcGkFRYKDqVzb_etNVe8-A,1,"I also had the endless salad bar (which stopped at one bowl), the bell peppers were funky, as were the artichokes, and the spinach was wilted."
562,JcGkFRYKDqVzb_etNVe8-A,1," My coworkers had the mac and cheese and ribs, respectively, and neither finished."
562,JcGkFRYKDqVzb_etNVe8-A,1,"They say hunger is the best spice, and we were hungry!"
562,JcGkFRYKDqVzb_etNVe8-A,1,"  Unfortunately, we were all disgusted."
562,JcGkFRYKDqVzb_etNVe8-A,1," The ribs were clearly not cooked at the same time, one half of the rack was way overcooked."
562,JcGkFRYKDqVzb_etNVe8-A,1, The Mac and Cheese went less than half eaten.
562,JcGkFRYKDqVzb_etNVe8-A,1,"I wish, in retrospect, that I had some photos to share, because it didn't even look good."
563,xO7YxfWUoeZcr8pvPqu1Uw,5,I've gotta give this place a five star rating.
563,xO7YxfWUoeZcr8pvPqu1Uw,5,I went on my 32nd birthday.
563,xO7YxfWUoeZcr8pvPqu1Uw,5,The food may take a while but good things come to those who wait.
563,xO7YxfWUoeZcr8pvPqu1Uw,5,"Here is the kind We got there and the Chef ,  Victor has beenthere for 13 years made me the Ultimate Colossal Burger from memory a to the fact it is no longer on the menu ."
563,xO7YxfWUoeZcr8pvPqu1Uw,5,This country  needs more people like Chef Victor.

564,ytROt2YsBBQ7TDMON2pKLQ,1,"Salad station empty of lettuce (4 empty bowls that were supposed to be filled with different types of lettuce), and many other things."
564,ytROt2YsBBQ7TDMON2pKLQ,1," We asked that it be restocked, and they slowly did so, with tiny amounts of refills."
564,ytROt2YsBBQ7TDMON2pKLQ,1, It was empty again within 10 minutes.
564,ytROt2YsBBQ7TDMON2pKLQ,1," Again, nobody restocked it."
564,ytROt2YsBBQ7TDMON2pKLQ,1, My wife went to the ladies room and said it looked like no one had cleaned it in days.
564,ytROt2YsBBQ7TDMON2pKLQ,1," BurgerPalace used to be good, and I understand the issue with a lack of help, but there were two workers standing at the entrance greeting people.  Perhaps they could have been more attentive."
564,ytROt2YsBBQ7TDMON2pKLQ,1, We won't be going back.
564,ytROt2YsBBQ7TDMON2pKLQ,1,Too bad.
565,BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,This is the only BurgerPalace in the Rhode Island/Eastern Massachusetts area.
565,BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,"Generally, we have been pleased with our past experiences at the BurgerPalaces we've dined at (including some that have closed.)This month"
565,BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,", on a pleasant evening, we decided to make a special trip to this Wrentham location for dinner, arriving a little before 7:00."
565,BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,THEY WERE CLOSED!
565,BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,"We had used the iPhone Maps app, which posts their closing time as 9:00."
565,BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,"Then I checked Google, which also lists their closing time as 9:00."
565,BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,"Then I checked Yelp, which has the closing time as 10:00!!BurgerPalace itself has posted on Yelp."
565,BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,They know about their listing there!Three major sites that people rely upon for hours of operation
565,BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,are all wrong!
565,BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,"If only one was wrong, that would be bad enough, but ALL THREE are off by several hours!"
565,BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,"And CONTINUE to be!With gas at $5/gallon, we wasted money and time."
565,BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,And our evening plans were ruined.
565,BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,A word to the wise: DON'T GO TO THIS RUBY TUESDAY FOR DINNER.
565,BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,You can't rely upon their posted hours.
565,BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,"If a zero-star rating was possible, that's what we would give this BurgerPalace experience."
565,BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1," By definition, food doesn't get worse than NO food, and service doesn't get worse than NO"
565,BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,serviceHopefully
565,BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,", all the hours of operations will be corrected soon, so others won't have the same aggravating experience."
565,BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,"Or better yet, BurgerPalace could stay open until at least 9:00."
566,vBSKm34_3xti93Q3iBmoyw,1,Last Tuesday my girlfriend made a Reservation for the out side seating  for this Friday  and said we have small dog .
566,vBSKm34_3xti93Q3iBmoyw,1,The person on the phone said dog are allowed and we have  Reservations outside .
566,vBSKm34_3xti93Q3iBmoyw,1,Today we went there for 3:30 we were told they don't do Reservations and they don't allow dogs event out side  even though guy on phone said the allow  dogs and said Reservations are all set.
566,vBSKm34_3xti93Q3iBmoyw,1,THEY SHOULD train there  employees  on protocol and rules .
566,vBSKm34_3xti93Q3iBmoyw,1, So don't wast your time there when there own Employees don't know the rules about town people certain information that is required.
567,GGCn_t8mVfVXooCd7IwHbQ,2,We were a party of 11 and it was a friend bday.
567,GGCn_t8mVfVXooCd7IwHbQ,2,Our food came out at different times and my food by the time it came out everyone was done eating (and I ordered the same food as 2 people at my table).
567,GGCn_t8mVfVXooCd7IwHbQ,2,Other people who arrived after us got our food before us.
567,GGCn_t8mVfVXooCd7IwHbQ,2,The manager gave us a discount and apologized which was appreciated.
567,GGCn_t8mVfVXooCd7IwHbQ,2,Our waitress avoided us and didn't give us an explanation as to why the food was delayed.
567,GGCn_t8mVfVXooCd7IwHbQ,2,It felt like as soon as she knew we were getting irritated she stopped trying because she barely came to our table.
567,GGCn_t8mVfVXooCd7IwHbQ,2,As a result of her poor communication (the food late isn't her fault) it affected her tip.
567,GGCn_t8mVfVXooCd7IwHbQ,2,I've worked in food for 10+ years.
567,GGCn_t8mVfVXooCd7IwHbQ,2,You need to inform the customer and help them understand.
567,GGCn_t8mVfVXooCd7IwHbQ,2,Turns out a bunch of late orders came in as soon as we sat down - that's why the food was late.
567,GGCn_t8mVfVXooCd7IwHbQ,2,So the waitress definitely should have informed us.
567,GGCn_t8mVfVXooCd7IwHbQ,2,She was young so maybe it was her first time...?
567,GGCn_t8mVfVXooCd7IwHbQ,2,Idk but honestly we spend an hour and a half there and I'll never go again.
567,GGCn_t8mVfVXooCd7IwHbQ,2,Kudos to the manager for owning up to it and giving us compensation.
568,-xoKYqVZRqGkxmEOn8g08w,2,"When I walked in, waiters were not ready and had to wait when the restaurant was empty."
568,-xoKYqVZRqGkxmEOn8g08w,2,They were out pizza and queso.
568,-xoKYqVZRqGkxmEOn8g08w,2,"I walked up to the salad bar and almost all the plates from the ""clean"" pile were dirty."
568,-xoKYqVZRqGkxmEOn8g08w,2,Food was ok.
568,-xoKYqVZRqGkxmEOn8g08w,2,Not very good overall
569,gfvWCDwxcsY4iXAy5YXy0w,4,"I belong to their ""So Connected"" email club so from time to time I receive coupons via email for discounts and deals on the food here."
569,gfvWCDwxcsY4iXAy5YXy0w,4,Well this past weekend I received a coupon for buy one meal get one half off so my mother and I made the trip to the restaurant to put the coupon to use.
569,gfvWCDwxcsY4iXAy5YXy0w,4,We both got the hamburger meal and we both added the all-you-can-eat salad bar to our meals for a $5.99 upcharge.
569,gfvWCDwxcsY4iXAy5YXy0w,4,"The salad bar is a meal in itself, always with lots of choices and fresh ingredients."
569,gfvWCDwxcsY4iXAy5YXy0w,4,"I did notice this visit that the salad bar was missing both croutons and bacon bits, two of my favorite ingredients to a salad, so I was a bit disappointed but there were still plenty of other delicious ingredients to add to my salad so I was still pretty satisfied with the salad bar."
569,gfvWCDwxcsY4iXAy5YXy0w,4,On my last two visits I have noticed items missing from the salad bar but I am wondering if the reason may be that because the restaurant closes rather early on Sundays (we usually get there around 4 PM and they close down at 6 PM) they might not replenish things that run out on the salad bar around that time of the day.
569,gfvWCDwxcsY4iXAy5YXy0w,4,But of course that is just a theory.
569,gfvWCDwxcsY4iXAy5YXy0w,4,We both enjoyed our meals and the salad bar as an add-on really hit the spot.
569,gfvWCDwxcsY4iXAy5YXy0w,4,I noticed this time they have a new menu and they added some new items and took away others such as the hamburger sliders/salad bar combo which I used to order quite often (I hate to see that option go).
569,gfvWCDwxcsY4iXAy5YXy0w,4,A lot of the items featured on the new menu are the same as before but I did see a few changes.
569,gfvWCDwxcsY4iXAy5YXy0w,4,"Anyway, I am glad I got to visit the restaurant this weekend and I really did enjoy my meal!"
570,SylHywddSRipK8-B_PJpbA,1,We went today for lunch!
570,SylHywddSRipK8-B_PJpbA,1,Our waitress was Myisha and she was terrible!
570,SylHywddSRipK8-B_PJpbA,1,First we waited forever then I think she heard us complain so she finally came over and that was the last time we saw her until we got our check!
570,SylHywddSRipK8-B_PJpbA,1,Someone else brought our food!
570,SylHywddSRipK8-B_PJpbA,1, She brought my husband a plastic knife and fork to eat a steak.
570,SylHywddSRipK8-B_PJpbA,1,.
570,SylHywddSRipK8-B_PJpbA,1,And gave everyone around us real silverware.
570,SylHywddSRipK8-B_PJpbA,1, She had the personality of a door knob!
570,SylHywddSRipK8-B_PJpbA,1,The steak should have been med rare but was well done!
570,SylHywddSRipK8-B_PJpbA,1, Then my salad tasted like paper!
570,SylHywddSRipK8-B_PJpbA,1,The ranch had no flavor!
570,SylHywddSRipK8-B_PJpbA,1, 
570,SylHywddSRipK8-B_PJpbA,1,Needless to say... we won't be back!
570,SylHywddSRipK8-B_PJpbA,1,It was really bad!
570,SylHywddSRipK8-B_PJpbA,1, A waste of $30
571,xebLAMPRwCFLmgS2obQL4A,1,This restaurant is on its last legs.
571,xebLAMPRwCFLmgS2obQL4A,1,  Old oil in the fryer; food incorrectly made; servers and a manager who just don't care.
571,xebLAMPRwCFLmgS2obQL4A,1,"  While there are limited food options at Wrentham Outlets, anything is better than this."
572,fFKKIK6yspzynCt0T_qMuQ,2,No with you to post it this time went to take a client to lunch for his birthday only to find out the restaurant had closed supposedly temporarily I normally don't always go there because of a past experiences but it's just too much.
572,fFKKIK6yspzynCt0T_qMuQ,2,It would've been nice to see it posted online that they were closed and not just wait to you get to the door
573,kNYqrz8XXk6vP6rEJ1XfGA,3,I liked this place in the past ;but they havent been open for weeks.
573,kNYqrz8XXk6vP6rEJ1XfGA,3,Might be out of buisness
574,R1LIfgzaJOYKRQnCSv3YAQ,5,another amazing visit with my family!!!

574,R1LIfgzaJOYKRQnCSv3YAQ,5,we will keep coming back!!!
575,wECcXKowVFx8X9sOaitGYw,5,RT has the BEST salad bar anywhere!
575,wECcXKowVFx8X9sOaitGYw,5,And I love the bourbon hickory salmon.
575,wECcXKowVFx8X9sOaitGYw,5,Comes with sides of rice pilaf and grilled Zucchini.
575,wECcXKowVFx8X9sOaitGYw,5,Delicious!
575,wECcXKowVFx8X9sOaitGYw,5,We like to fill up on the salad bar and take our entree home for another meal.
575,wECcXKowVFx8X9sOaitGYw,5,Good way to get more bang for the buck.
575,wECcXKowVFx8X9sOaitGYw,5,And they put out buy one get one entree coupons.
575,wECcXKowVFx8X9sOaitGYw,5,What a deal!
576,nf3Ac0JQY30Fi20Mp-8XeA,5,Friendly staff and short wait.
576,nf3Ac0JQY30Fi20Mp-8XeA,5,The garden bar is always my favorite.
576,nf3Ac0JQY30Fi20Mp-8XeA,5,I also like the appetizer sampler and the others with me loved their burgers they ordered.
577,sRec1H7WUbUf7StpnrfIqg,1,Over priced and the food tasted less then ok.
577,sRec1H7WUbUf7StpnrfIqg,1,Was over $60 for 2 kids meals and 2 adult meals.
577,sRec1H7WUbUf7StpnrfIqg,1, They didn't take the tails off my daughters shrimp before frying it.
577,sRec1H7WUbUf7StpnrfIqg,1,I ate half my burger and my husband ate maybe half of his salmon salad.
577,sRec1H7WUbUf7StpnrfIqg,1,Service was all over the place.
577,sRec1H7WUbUf7StpnrfIqg,1,Our waiter asked if we were ready for our bill before we even got our food.
578,Al7-H0GiIk1dyulzyTbVPg,2,"When I walked in, I wasn't greeted but I was seated immediately."
578,Al7-H0GiIk1dyulzyTbVPg,2,The decor looked like something straight out of the 70's.
578,Al7-H0GiIk1dyulzyTbVPg,2,"The service was nice, but not fairly attentive."
578,Al7-H0GiIk1dyulzyTbVPg,2,I tried the salmon dish and felt my blood pressure rising with the first salty bite.
578,Al7-H0GiIk1dyulzyTbVPg,2,"The rib dish was okay, however."
578,Al7-H0GiIk1dyulzyTbVPg,2,Now the service was lackluster at best.
578,Al7-H0GiIk1dyulzyTbVPg,2,We had to keep flagging the server down and it took her almost 30 Minutes to acknowledge that our card had been on the table for us to pay.
578,Al7-H0GiIk1dyulzyTbVPg,2,"2 tables came after us, ate, and paid before we were able to leave."
579,DJVTczU2QG3pBsgZ41j9kg,1,We don't have a BurgerPalace where I amFrom so I convinced my husband for us to go out to dinner.
579,DJVTczU2QG3pBsgZ41j9kg,1,He had just gotten off work and re arrive around 5-5:15 we got sat at a table and right away no one came to us for about 10 minutes.
579,DJVTczU2QG3pBsgZ41j9kg,1,"I am a server so I went up to the host stand and waited for the host to get back, while I was waiting 3 other servers just stared at me."
579,DJVTczU2QG3pBsgZ41j9kg,1,When the host came back I told him we haven't seen anyone and he just looked confused so I just said thank you and walked back to our table.
579,DJVTczU2QG3pBsgZ41j9kg,1,We finally ended up getting a waitress but my husband ordered a beer in a bottle and I had to ask another server after 20 minutes for it.
579,DJVTczU2QG3pBsgZ41j9kg,1,We saw our server 2 times.
579,DJVTczU2QG3pBsgZ41j9kg,1,1 to take our order and one to hover over us with the check.
579,DJVTczU2QG3pBsgZ41j9kg,1,I didn't want to tip much because it was awful and I wanted to speak to the manager but the server handed my husband the ticket then stood there and put him under pressure.
579,DJVTczU2QG3pBsgZ41j9kg,1,I am not by any means trying to tell anyone how to do their job and we didn't act rude but it was the worst service I have ever had by far.
579,DJVTczU2QG3pBsgZ41j9kg,1,The other server in the section next to us was delightful.
580,GLO67nhXKSBeWR9W446kGQ,2,Ate here today (6-25-21).
580,GLO67nhXKSBeWR9W446kGQ,2,"My ""Top Shelf"" margarita, which cost $10, was very watered down."
580,GLO67nhXKSBeWR9W446kGQ,2,"My cheeseburger, which took a long time to arrive, was lukewarm."
581,7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1,Be forewarned!
581,7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1,This is NOT the place to go for good food.
581,7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1,We (my wife and I) ate here today and was EXTREMELY disappointed.
581,7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1, Here are the following FAILED grades:1) Wait staff not consistently wearing masks.
581,7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1, I had to ask our waitress to pull hers up when she came to our table2) I ordered their 6 oz Sirloin Medium Rare.
581,7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1, It was served cooked well done...actually waaaay overdone.
581,7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1," It was inedible, like a hockey puck."
581,7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1, I did not eat it3)
581,7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1,I ordered a baked potato with butter only...it was served with sour cream only.
581,7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1,I do not like sour cream on my potato.
581,7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1,I did not eat it4)
581,7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1,We had to ask for salt 5) The spinach artichoke dip was watery and tasteless.6)
581,7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1,My wife's broccoli was very salty.
581,7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1, She did not eat it.
581,7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1,I told our waitress about the overdone steak and the potato and she asked what I wanted to do about it.
581,7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1," I told her at least take my plate off the bill, which they did."
581,7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1, Then I asked to see the manager and was told he was very busy helping in the kitchen as they were short staffed today.
581,7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1, I think that is the answer to my poor serving.
581,7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1," Also, since no one was actively supervising the staff, they felt free to wander around without their masks on."
581,7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1,This was the worst experience I have had in a restaurant in years.
581,7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1," It is doubtful that I will eat there again unless all I want is their salad bar, which was very tasty."
581,7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1," Therefore, all I had for dinner was a salad and some corn."
581,7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1,Good luck if you eat here.
581,7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1, 
581,7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1,Be prepared to not get anything like you expected.
581,7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1, I didn't bother asking for a new plate because of the nearly half hour wait to begin with.
582,-1DIQjCw_x-xQPIzf7llmA,1,Ribeye steak was extremely tough and had so much oil it just streams down your throat like drinking Wesson oil.
582,-1DIQjCw_x-xQPIzf7llmA,1,Traded it back for loaded chicken nachos which the manager brought herself and apparently she took offense to how horrible I said the steak was because there was barely anything on the $10.99 nachos so I cut my losses and had chips for $11 +.
582,-1DIQjCw_x-xQPIzf7llmA,1,"Friend had ribs, shrimp, fries, chicken tenders and zucchini."
582,-1DIQjCw_x-xQPIzf7llmA,1,"Ribs were not good, shrimp wasn't really shrimp it's the cheap knockoff."
582,-1DIQjCw_x-xQPIzf7llmA,1,5 little zucchini slices.
582,-1DIQjCw_x-xQPIzf7llmA,1,Fries and chicken tenders are good and the tea is really great.
582,-1DIQjCw_x-xQPIzf7llmA,1,If the manager had cared we would have been back.
582,-1DIQjCw_x-xQPIzf7llmA,1,People don't care about customers who keep the company in business which keeps them employed.
582,-1DIQjCw_x-xQPIzf7llmA,1,We won't be back.
583,-6vtZgrFDU1r19ivSi1H0w,2,The Crispy Chicken Sandwich has delicious chicken breast but the pimento topping was too salty.
583,-6vtZgrFDU1r19ivSi1H0w,2,A lot.
583,-6vtZgrFDU1r19ivSi1H0w,2,"Delicious Garden Bar; quite nice romaine, spinach, and salad mix, large selection of trendy toppings."
583,-6vtZgrFDU1r19ivSi1H0w,2,Very friendly server.
584,A0YQzNy7Z1OEraQBMhqKsg,1,I guess I have to choose one star.
584,A0YQzNy7Z1OEraQBMhqKsg,1, Nothing lower.  The takeout pictures really speak for themselves.
584,A0YQzNy7Z1OEraQBMhqKsg,1, Paid over $100.
585,r-3ggTIkzIX0ohZRLWTZaA,1,Monday at 4:pm .
585,r-3ggTIkzIX0ohZRLWTZaA,1,"Food took 40 minutes, only one other couple sitting in the restaurant and they had already gotten food when we ordered."
585,r-3ggTIkzIX0ohZRLWTZaA,1,We ordered 3 kids burgers with fry's and a grilled chicken sandwich (soggy bun) with tater tots.
585,r-3ggTIkzIX0ohZRLWTZaA,1,Should'nt take 40 min.
585,r-3ggTIkzIX0ohZRLWTZaA,1,"I got the salad bar, I got the last ""clean plate"" no good lettuce,"
585,r-3ggTIkzIX0ohZRLWTZaA,1,"The other type of lettuce was brown, the waitress was sweet and friendly."
585,r-3ggTIkzIX0ohZRLWTZaA,1,"It was so slow the staff were all sitting around the bar chatting, music was sooo loud I couldn't hear anyone talking around the table, she kindly turned it down after I asked, worst music selection ever, then it was turned back up 5 min later."
585,r-3ggTIkzIX0ohZRLWTZaA,1,We will not be coming back.
585,r-3ggTIkzIX0ohZRLWTZaA,1,Oh and the bathroom was disgusting!
586,5TjLpJlDUUFZb5YUa9mMpQ,1,We were in Cadillac on Thursday and wanted to have a nice sit down lunch.
586,5TjLpJlDUUFZb5YUa9mMpQ,1, We did get to sit down.
586,5TjLpJlDUUFZb5YUa9mMpQ,1, We sat for over 15 min. before the waitress decided to come to our table.
586,5TjLpJlDUUFZb5YUa9mMpQ,1,There were not many people but some of them we watched her visit 3 times before coming to take our drink order.
586,5TjLpJlDUUFZb5YUa9mMpQ,1," Order was not right and beware of ordering the mushrooms on your steak,  they use it to hide the steak with more fat and gristle than meat."
586,5TjLpJlDUUFZb5YUa9mMpQ,1, As we had been on the road several hours and were very hungry we ate what we could even though most of it was cold.  We had to flag waitress down to get check so we could leave.  I really wish the waitress would have taken the hair scrunchie off her wrist and tied up her long hair.
587,VRoLD9J5NrvOaL8eF_ns9Q,1,We were driving back from Traverse City and wanted to sit down to eat.
587,VRoLD9J5NrvOaL8eF_ns9Q,1,"As we walked in, there we tons of signs promising scan codes of menus and there was a table just to recruit new workers."
587,VRoLD9J5NrvOaL8eF_ns9Q,1,"We were immediately seated with regular plastic menus and as we looked around, there was no one else dining in the restaurant."
587,VRoLD9J5NrvOaL8eF_ns9Q,1,That should have been the first clue.
587,VRoLD9J5NrvOaL8eF_ns9Q,1,"My husband ordered a Shiner Bock, but the waitress said they didn't have it, it wasn't on tap and had no clue what it was, although it was listed right there on the menu."
587,VRoLD9J5NrvOaL8eF_ns9Q,1,The plastic menus were ripped an old... how would she not know?
587,VRoLD9J5NrvOaL8eF_ns9Q,1,He finally settled on one of the five beers she did know: Sam Adams Summer Ale.
587,VRoLD9J5NrvOaL8eF_ns9Q,1,"So, we ordered from an extremely pared down menu and she brought out my husband's beer."
587,VRoLD9J5NrvOaL8eF_ns9Q,1,He took his first sip and it was flat and warm.
587,VRoLD9J5NrvOaL8eF_ns9Q,1,There was barely any head on it and no moisture on the outside of the glass.
587,VRoLD9J5NrvOaL8eF_ns9Q,1,"After going over their blah menu, dealing with their snippy and unknowledgeable waitress, then receiving a warm beer that was flat, we just left."
587,VRoLD9J5NrvOaL8eF_ns9Q,1,"If they couldn't keep their beer at temperature, would they be able to cook their food to temperature to ensure safety?"
587,VRoLD9J5NrvOaL8eF_ns9Q,1,We didn't want to chance it.
587,VRoLD9J5NrvOaL8eF_ns9Q,1,Won't be back.
588,Y6a_XNZRpnf-Y-K98tpC2A,1,Hesitated stopping here on a recent Sunday visit to Cadillac.
588,Y6a_XNZRpnf-Y-K98tpC2A,1,"Very few cars in the lot, was expecting quick and quiet meal."
588,Y6a_XNZRpnf-Y-K98tpC2A,1," After standing at the front door for a few minutes, the hostess asked us to wait a minute to clean off a table."
588,Y6a_XNZRpnf-Y-K98tpC2A,1," There were very few patrons in the restaurant, not sure why another table wasn't ready and  available."
588,Y6a_XNZRpnf-Y-K98tpC2A,1," After she walked away, she returned a few minutes later and said it would be 10-15 minutes before a table would be ready.  A quick scan of the entire restaurant showed 5 tables in use, far far below any covid restrictions."
588,Y6a_XNZRpnf-Y-K98tpC2A,1, 
588,Y6a_XNZRpnf-Y-K98tpC2A,1,When I asked why we couldn't sit at one of the other available tables she said that wasn't possible.
588,Y6a_XNZRpnf-Y-K98tpC2A,1, I politely said I was not waiting and she said 'OK'.
588,Y6a_XNZRpnf-Y-K98tpC2A,1," Several of their restaurants have closed, its certainly not an easy business.  Unfortunately one more example of the wrong person at the front door."
589,lL8dyhtpajjFtk39o_RgOQ,2,"With the buy one get one special coupon in hand, I decided to give them another go."
589,lL8dyhtpajjFtk39o_RgOQ,2," Due to the rona, I used curbside pickup."
589,lL8dyhtpajjFtk39o_RgOQ,2," The curbside system when using a coupon could use some tweaking, such as being able to use the coupon with online ordering instead of requiring the order to be phoned in, and some way to make payment without personal contact."
589,lL8dyhtpajjFtk39o_RgOQ,2," Food wise, not much has changed."
589,lL8dyhtpajjFtk39o_RgOQ,2, 
589,lL8dyhtpajjFtk39o_RgOQ,2,Ordered steaks/baked potato/salad.
589,lL8dyhtpajjFtk39o_RgOQ,2," The steaks, while cooked as ordered, were completely without flavor."
589,lL8dyhtpajjFtk39o_RgOQ,2, No flavor.
589,lL8dyhtpajjFtk39o_RgOQ,2, No seasoning.
589,lL8dyhtpajjFtk39o_RgOQ,2, Zero flavor.
589,lL8dyhtpajjFtk39o_RgOQ,2, How do you kill the flavor of a steak?
589,lL8dyhtpajjFtk39o_RgOQ,2," Even when effectively half price, I still felt somewhat cheated."
589,lL8dyhtpajjFtk39o_RgOQ,2," Maybe burgers are their thing, but it's not steaks."
590,g8Z1nj1_Yatd7lmDD7vM5w,2,First time at this BurgerPalace
590,g8Z1nj1_Yatd7lmDD7vM5w,2,All the staff were very friendly and the restaurant appeared to be clean.
590,g8Z1nj1_Yatd7lmDD7vM5w,2,It wasn't too busy for it being a Saturday night.
590,g8Z1nj1_Yatd7lmDD7vM5w,2,I observed the salad bar and it was pretty sad.
590,g8Z1nj1_Yatd7lmDD7vM5w,2,A lot of stuff was pretty low and it didn't look like any of the staff were concerned about it.
590,g8Z1nj1_Yatd7lmDD7vM5w,2,I ordered the grilled chicken salad and my guest had the 8 oz sirloin.
590,g8Z1nj1_Yatd7lmDD7vM5w,2,Our waiter was at attentive and overly friendly.
590,g8Z1nj1_Yatd7lmDD7vM5w,2,However after receiving our food the drink refills went down.
590,g8Z1nj1_Yatd7lmDD7vM5w,2,I waited over 10 minutes before I got my water refilled.
590,g8Z1nj1_Yatd7lmDD7vM5w,2,Nothing special about the food.
590,g8Z1nj1_Yatd7lmDD7vM5w,2,The grilled chicken salad was $12 and to be honest Zaxby's has a bigger and more ingredients in their salads and it's $8.
590,g8Z1nj1_Yatd7lmDD7vM5w,2,My guest said the steak was very chewy and was bland.
590,g8Z1nj1_Yatd7lmDD7vM5w,2,Not impressed with this restaurant and won't be back.
590,g8Z1nj1_Yatd7lmDD7vM5w,2,"Looking for a great salad, go to Zaxby's up the street."
591,IQsdSEkO8-aPuWMcUy-mCg,1,"You would think a national brand BurgerPalace would be concerned about food and customer service, guess not."
591,IQsdSEkO8-aPuWMcUy-mCg,1," Went for lunch ordered the special cheeseburger, restaurant maybe 50 % full, 37 minutes later the cheeseburger finally showed up.  Thought this was a rather long wait so went back 2 weeks later with some friends and ordered the special, cheeseburger with extra tots."
591,IQsdSEkO8-aPuWMcUy-mCg,1, 35 minutes later and we finally started getting our food.
591,IQsdSEkO8-aPuWMcUy-mCg,1, I will say RT makes a very good burger BUT 35 minutes is far to long.  Mentioned the long wait to the manager and all we got was shrugged shoulders.
591,IQsdSEkO8-aPuWMcUy-mCg,1, 
591,IQsdSEkO8-aPuWMcUy-mCg,1,"Went today for the salad bar special (no wait for a salad bar) another person order mac and cheese and a bowl of broccoli and 30 minutes went buy before her food came, RT was maybe 40% full."
591,IQsdSEkO8-aPuWMcUy-mCg,1, Would have mentioned or should say compline to the manager but he was too busy socializing.
591,IQsdSEkO8-aPuWMcUy-mCg,1, Since this is one of the few places in Lenoir to eat lunch other than McDonalds it's sad.
591,IQsdSEkO8-aPuWMcUy-mCg,1, But I'll take my money elsewhere.
591,IQsdSEkO8-aPuWMcUy-mCg,1, My best advice unless you have a good hour or more eat anywhere else but here.
592,1GAhn55wasZ7KRAPKbbrzA,5,We have recently started visiting BurgerPalace near Health Park in Ft. Myers.
592,1GAhn55wasZ7KRAPKbbrzA,5,They have been offering great specials and you can't beat the prices.
592,1GAhn55wasZ7KRAPKbbrzA,5, We normally have a drink or 2 and then order food to go.
592,1GAhn55wasZ7KRAPKbbrzA,5, We have had excellent service in the bar area.
592,1GAhn55wasZ7KRAPKbbrzA,5," Nate, the bartender, has been our server and we have always had great service with him."
592,1GAhn55wasZ7KRAPKbbrzA,5," The food is always consistent and tastes fantastic,"
592,1GAhn55wasZ7KRAPKbbrzA,5,The specials are priced lower than any restaurants I have been to.
592,1GAhn55wasZ7KRAPKbbrzA,5, They have a great endless salad bar which is also reasonably priced.
592,1GAhn55wasZ7KRAPKbbrzA,5, You can add it to your meal for a nominal fee.
592,1GAhn55wasZ7KRAPKbbrzA,5,Check the specials before you go!
592,1GAhn55wasZ7KRAPKbbrzA,5,"If you sit at the bar, I would recommend having Nate as your server!"
592,1GAhn55wasZ7KRAPKbbrzA,5, We will be back.
593,O-BK0SXQ2K1lwazJm3dqtg,3,Came in for my birthday burger.
593,O-BK0SXQ2K1lwazJm3dqtg,3,I was hesitant based on my last two visits which were total disappointments.
593,O-BK0SXQ2K1lwazJm3dqtg,3, The wait staff was courteous and took my order right away.
593,O-BK0SXQ2K1lwazJm3dqtg,3, The burger was cooked perfect and the tots were crispy.
593,O-BK0SXQ2K1lwazJm3dqtg,3," I took this order to go, as I live close by."
593,O-BK0SXQ2K1lwazJm3dqtg,3,I might have given another star except they forgot to put the tomato I asked for on the burger.
593,O-BK0SXQ2K1lwazJm3dqtg,3, Otherwise a decent experience.
594,GI0oKoI9P8o2uBIQTh6zBA,1,This is the second time I've been cheated by BurgerPalace  The first time I ordered delivery and received all the confirming numbers.  
594,GI0oKoI9P8o2uBIQTh6zBA,1,The order was 30 mins late and so I called.
594,GI0oKoI9P8o2uBIQTh6zBA,1, They had just received the order which was placed and confirmed more than an hour earlier.
594,GI0oKoI9P8o2uBIQTh6zBA,1, We're sorry there was a mix up and uber canceled the pick up because it wasn't ready.
594,GI0oKoI9P8o2uBIQTh6zBA,1, I had to go pick up my order which was cold and I'd already tipped the driver.
594,GI0oKoI9P8o2uBIQTh6zBA,1, Just now I received my order which was missing half the items.
594,GI0oKoI9P8o2uBIQTh6zBA,1, 
594,GI0oKoI9P8o2uBIQTh6zBA,1,Ordered Salmon salad.
594,GI0oKoI9P8o2uBIQTh6zBA,1, 
594,GI0oKoI9P8o2uBIQTh6zBA,1,Received a piece of salmon with no salad.
594,GI0oKoI9P8o2uBIQTh6zBA,1, 
594,GI0oKoI9P8o2uBIQTh6zBA,1,Ordered a ruby relaxer..no relaxer.
594,GI0oKoI9P8o2uBIQTh6zBA,1, Ordered cole slaw...no cole slaw.
594,GI0oKoI9P8o2uBIQTh6zBA,1, Called.
594,GI0oKoI9P8o2uBIQTh6zBA,1, I have been on hold now for 15 minutes while they check on it.
594,GI0oKoI9P8o2uBIQTh6zBA,1, I will NEVER use delivery nor patronize Ruby's again.
594,GI0oKoI9P8o2uBIQTh6zBA,1, Still on hold!
595,oILpIpT_zEvtj2Nb6GXtWg,5,Been a few years since I had been to a RT.
595,oILpIpT_zEvtj2Nb6GXtWg,5," Salad bar still as great as I remember, and the one at this location was kept well stocked and attractive."
595,oILpIpT_zEvtj2Nb6GXtWg,5, Our server Shawn was top notch.
595,oILpIpT_zEvtj2Nb6GXtWg,5, Great place.
596,KYrguHbxxgo3aCLnZJf59w,5,Absolutely delightful lunch there!
596,KYrguHbxxgo3aCLnZJf59w,5, Spotless over all areas!
596,KYrguHbxxgo3aCLnZJf59w,5," Staff prepped (masked, poor folks!) and friendly, excellent service from Michele."
596,KYrguHbxxgo3aCLnZJf59w,5," Salad bar was top shelf!  Had a seat in view of it and it was entertaining to watch others 'build' their salad towers!Got a coupon from corporate for BOGO so it was delightfully inexpensive, but we DID tip on what the total would have been....don't you??  (wait tables for awhile,"
596,KYrguHbxxgo3aCLnZJf59w,5,you will understand)We
596,KYrguHbxxgo3aCLnZJf59w,5,WILL be back!
597,tEMoBlNRxS55yYAeRsfkoQ,5,Always nice to sit at the high tops near the bar.
597,tEMoBlNRxS55yYAeRsfkoQ,5, Attendees always friendly and talkative.
597,tEMoBlNRxS55yYAeRsfkoQ,5,Nice place to eat and drink.
597,tEMoBlNRxS55yYAeRsfkoQ,5,We come all the way from Babcock Ranch to eat there once in a while.
598,2naXFkYq6EcHtYaqq6OHow,4,I would have given it 5 stars.
598,2naXFkYq6EcHtYaqq6OHow,4,The service is good.
598,2naXFkYq6EcHtYaqq6OHow,4,The servers are efficient.
598,2naXFkYq6EcHtYaqq6OHow,4,The food is excellent and reasonably priced.
598,2naXFkYq6EcHtYaqq6OHow,4,BUT the wifi is not secure and my antivirus program will not allow me to log on.
599,gaR9C0v8Ud94DKAZnRGkqQ,2,Apparently the only way to get served is I'd you're a regular bar fly.
599,gaR9C0v8Ud94DKAZnRGkqQ,2, 3 people at the bar and one table.
599,gaR9C0v8Ud94DKAZnRGkqQ,2, The bartender Christian refilled everyone else's drinks.. texted.
599,gaR9C0v8Ud94DKAZnRGkqQ,2,Ate and still 15 minutes later not asked if i wanted to order.  While I understand regulars have an established relationship with the staff... it's probably not the best to ignore local customers...
599,gaR9C0v8Ud94DKAZnRGkqQ,2,that being said i will not return to this location and will recommend just about any where else at this point...
599,gaR9C0v8Ud94DKAZnRGkqQ,2,i have consistently received poor service here and complaints fall on deaf ears
600,jng8mdaLPIfyt6rJ8Vn_Aw,1,Super Bowl Sunday
600,jng8mdaLPIfyt6rJ8Vn_Aw,1,.
600,jng8mdaLPIfyt6rJ8Vn_Aw,1,The place was dead at 6:40pm.
600,jng8mdaLPIfyt6rJ8Vn_Aw,1,Drinks were okay.
600,jng8mdaLPIfyt6rJ8Vn_Aw,1,The food was horrible.
600,jng8mdaLPIfyt6rJ8Vn_Aw,1,I was with 2 other friends.
600,jng8mdaLPIfyt6rJ8Vn_Aw,1,"The shrimp fondue tasted spoiled, the chips with the fondue were stale, they brought out crackers, but the taste of the shrimp fondue just wasn't right."
600,jng8mdaLPIfyt6rJ8Vn_Aw,1,They took that off our bill.
600,jng8mdaLPIfyt6rJ8Vn_Aw,1,Which was nice.
600,jng8mdaLPIfyt6rJ8Vn_Aw,1,My friends mashed potatoes tasted spoiled as well.
600,jng8mdaLPIfyt6rJ8Vn_Aw,1,It was not a good meal.
600,jng8mdaLPIfyt6rJ8Vn_Aw,1,"The service was slow, the food was off."
600,jng8mdaLPIfyt6rJ8Vn_Aw,1,Check your expiration dates and temps in your fridge and coolers.
601,VwgPxsINFnSnKjtqzGcrww,5,It seemed to me to be pretty odd that my hubby and I were the only guests at the we arrived.
601,VwgPxsINFnSnKjtqzGcrww,5, My day had just flown by no wonder...it was 8:30pm.
601,VwgPxsINFnSnKjtqzGcrww,5, My goodness no wonder and with the 4th of July holiday many people were with their families.
601,VwgPxsINFnSnKjtqzGcrww,5, BurgerPalace was very clean and inviting.
601,VwgPxsINFnSnKjtqzGcrww,5, Nathaniel was our server very prompt and friendly.
601,VwgPxsINFnSnKjtqzGcrww,5,  My hubby and I both ordered a grilled chicken quesadilla and sweet tea.
601,VwgPxsINFnSnKjtqzGcrww,5,  It was so good!
601,VwgPxsINFnSnKjtqzGcrww,5, All of the staff were friendly and welcoming.
602,KEhXJJS6y7TDWebH1oo61g,2,The service was great.
602,KEhXJJS6y7TDWebH1oo61g,2, My issue is that BurgerPalace changed their menu removing what used to be called a customer favorite and they replaced most menu items making them resemble Applebees and TGIF.
602,KEhXJJS6y7TDWebH1oo61g,2, Why take away a fan favorite?
602,KEhXJJS6y7TDWebH1oo61g,2, When asked if they could make it I was told that although the chef agreed and loved the dish too he didn't have the ingredients to make it for me.
602,KEhXJJS6y7TDWebH1oo61g,2, It was Fresco chicken and it was amazing.
602,KEhXJJS6y7TDWebH1oo61g,2, Please bring it back and I will continue to be the loyal customer ive been for 15 years.
603,VE5t8TjDA0irr3eUqAQc6A,1,"My mom and I were hungry and decided to try BurgerPalace in big rapids,"
603,VE5t8TjDA0irr3eUqAQc6A,1,"we were seated immediately, the young lady took our order and when she brought us our sprite both cups had black dirty stuff floating in and on the cup, the cup had a waxy feeling, we explained it to her and she brought us another cup that was dirty as well,"
603,VE5t8TjDA0irr3eUqAQc6A,1,"we complained about the cup three times and just decided to not drink out of it, when she brought us our food my fries were undercooked and salty, my chicken sandwich had this crusted sauce on it that looked like curdled milk, it was blend and had no flavor whats so ever, my mom ordered a carbonara pasta and it was soupy, if I wanted to eat trash I would've ate my trash can at home for free."
603,VE5t8TjDA0irr3eUqAQc6A,1,NEVER AGAIN....
604,xpUZSeqT5c3FDEJlmiXMJg,1,"Again, I tried the Cheese Burger today sad to say it was burned on one side and dried out to the point it was uneatable, I ordered it medium....way overcooked."
604,xpUZSeqT5c3FDEJlmiXMJg,1,"I understand that all places are having trouble getting help but this is beyond the point, need to train the cooks before you lose your good customers."
604,xpUZSeqT5c3FDEJlmiXMJg,1,The really sad thing is I went in to use the restroom and it was filthy (disgustingly dirty) looed like it has not been cleaned in a week or more.
605,OPNUREgqgAnDh1dFXr9D_A,5,"I have to say, my recent visit here was top notch!"
605,OPNUREgqgAnDh1dFXr9D_A,5, They were crazy busy (Mothers day).
605,OPNUREgqgAnDh1dFXr9D_A,5,We stopped here while traveling.
605,OPNUREgqgAnDh1dFXr9D_A,5,We sat at the bar (with no wait).
605,OPNUREgqgAnDh1dFXr9D_A,5,Our bartenders were great.
605,OPNUREgqgAnDh1dFXr9D_A,5,Not only did our drink and food come out much faster than expected.
605,OPNUREgqgAnDh1dFXr9D_A,5,Our bartenders maintained great attitudes and were very entertaining.
605,OPNUREgqgAnDh1dFXr9D_A,5,Anyone could see they were struggling with being short staffed and busy.
605,OPNUREgqgAnDh1dFXr9D_A,5,Thanks for a great visit for a few hungry travelers!
605,OPNUREgqgAnDh1dFXr9D_A,5, I would stop again.
606,Jnq_FECyLv2rAAQ-bRY5jg,4,I sat at the bar and had my meal.
606,Jnq_FECyLv2rAAQ-bRY5jg,4,The ribs were hot as were the fries.
606,Jnq_FECyLv2rAAQ-bRY5jg,4,Beer choices were good too.
606,Jnq_FECyLv2rAAQ-bRY5jg,4,Some local brews on tap as usual.
606,Jnq_FECyLv2rAAQ-bRY5jg,4,Overall I enjoyed eating here.
606,Jnq_FECyLv2rAAQ-bRY5jg,4,"I did note the bar surface to be a little sticky, but I put that down to zealous staff cleaning everywhere."
607,Xd56ABx89BtyobqR8FSMBw,5,They are Permanently Closed.

608,ffo2CeMZRH0SRIYahZT_nw,3,"Bland, bland, bland."
608,ffo2CeMZRH0SRIYahZT_nw,3,We ordered the special of cheesesteak hoagie with french fries and/or tater tots.
608,ffo2CeMZRH0SRIYahZT_nw,3,The subs were tasteless and a scant amount of meat.
608,ffo2CeMZRH0SRIYahZT_nw,3,Not worth the promotional amount of money $7.99 + $2 for mediocre 8 fried shrimp-totally pre-packaged.
608,ffo2CeMZRH0SRIYahZT_nw,3,Really poor.
608,ffo2CeMZRH0SRIYahZT_nw,3,"The service was good, have to say."
608,ffo2CeMZRH0SRIYahZT_nw,3,"The food quantity and quality, pass it up."
609,-DypHwIK-wqTm-t5rWCGKg,1,"Not only did they forget an entire meal, for our child which was the entire reason we ordered from them, but did not include any condiments and sent incorrect beverages."
609,-DypHwIK-wqTm-t5rWCGKg,1,Don't Uber Eats if you expect any amount of competence.
610,5TvkE88Bpnb7OHqV0n64Kw,3,Three of the four front doors were locked when we got here; even though it was only around 2 pm on a Saturday.
610,5TvkE88Bpnb7OHqV0n64Kw,3,"For some reason the hours posted on the door don't include closing times, either."
610,5TvkE88Bpnb7OHqV0n64Kw,3,"There's just a blank space and then ""PM""."
610,5TvkE88Bpnb7OHqV0n64Kw,3,My husband and I ordered appetizers and were not very impressed by the foods' appearance.
610,5TvkE88Bpnb7OHqV0n64Kw,3,"We ordered the sampler which said it came with chicken wings on the menu, and instead, came with chicken tenders."
610,5TvkE88Bpnb7OHqV0n64Kw,3,"The marinara sauce for the mozzarella sticks was no good, and the artichoke dip was too thick."
610,5TvkE88Bpnb7OHqV0n64Kw,3,We also ordered the loaded cheese fries and the bacon bits were way too big for how dry they were.
610,5TvkE88Bpnb7OHqV0n64Kw,3,"The fry-to-topping ratio was way out of proportion with a very small amount of melted shredded cheese, a large amount of bacon bits (seemingly meant for salad) and a minuscule amount of sour cream."
610,5TvkE88Bpnb7OHqV0n64Kw,3,"The establishment is disgusting, with something sticky and brown covering the walls of the booths."
610,5TvkE88Bpnb7OHqV0n64Kw,3,"The table was not clean when we were sat there, nor was it well-organized."
610,5TvkE88Bpnb7OHqV0n64Kw,3,The service was okay.
610,5TvkE88Bpnb7OHqV0n64Kw,3,"The floor and tables dirty, and for some reason there were leaves everywhere."
610,5TvkE88Bpnb7OHqV0n64Kw,3,This was my first time going to a BurgerPalace and I don't think I'll go back.
611,MNpeRLySnjbq5lt-GcWUaw,3,Floor even on carpet is sticky.
611,MNpeRLySnjbq5lt-GcWUaw,3, Staff less than impressive.
611,MNpeRLySnjbq5lt-GcWUaw,3, Staff forgot one order completely.
611,MNpeRLySnjbq5lt-GcWUaw,3, Frying oil very old.
611,MNpeRLySnjbq5lt-GcWUaw,3, All food was over cooked.
611,MNpeRLySnjbq5lt-GcWUaw,3, Bathrooms not clean.
611,MNpeRLySnjbq5lt-GcWUaw,3, 
611,MNpeRLySnjbq5lt-GcWUaw,3,Went at a non busy time too
612,n2dlO6KxZUH9KFXZmrv1wQ,4,Went to BurgerPalace on 2/22/2022 .
612,n2dlO6KxZUH9KFXZmrv1wQ,4,I ordered Shrimp Scampi and my companion ordered ribs.
612,n2dlO6KxZUH9KFXZmrv1wQ,4,Our server was Monica.
612,n2dlO6KxZUH9KFXZmrv1wQ,4,She was very attentive and helpful..
612,n2dlO6KxZUH9KFXZmrv1wQ,4,If you go to  950 International Drive.
612,n2dlO6KxZUH9KFXZmrv1wQ,4,Ask for her you won't be sorry.
613,iFt1Fk7Urw9O_z1TOkGeRA,1,I was very disappointed in the Customer Service and Communication here!
613,iFt1Fk7Urw9O_z1TOkGeRA,1,We called and ordered our food for carryout 30 minutes before we got to the restaurant.
613,iFt1Fk7Urw9O_z1TOkGeRA,1,"When we got there, we walked to the bar area."
613,iFt1Fk7Urw9O_z1TOkGeRA,1, The bartender tells us to go around the corner for pickup orders ....we get to the pickup window and no one is there
613,iFt1Fk7Urw9O_z1TOkGeRA,1,....we wait 5 min and a young lady comes out the kitchen and asks for our order name....then she walks away and never talks to us again.  She and the bartender walks back and forth serving customers while we are just standing there looking at others being served.
613,iFt1Fk7Urw9O_z1TOkGeRA,1,"This is now approx. 50 min since we called the order in.....someone could have at least came to say our order is coming up, they forgot to make it, sorry for the inconvenience, or anything but instead we were just ignored by the numerous employees goin in and out of the kitchen."
613,iFt1Fk7Urw9O_z1TOkGeRA,1,We eventually had to walk out and get food elsewhere.
613,iFt1Fk7Urw9O_z1TOkGeRA,1,Such a shame because my frustration could have been tamed by a simple acknowledgement.
613,iFt1Fk7Urw9O_z1TOkGeRA,1,Will not be going back.
614,Xzv4XlukEKPK1KkBJTqA1Q,3,Best Salad Bar Ever.
614,Xzv4XlukEKPK1KkBJTqA1Q,3,"Good Decent menu with appetizers, main entrees, deserts."
615,M_NzeRcSqxvy75dn3iFN_g,5,"It's BurgerPalace Tuesday....but the service is great here, had a beer, ordered takeout, bartender was friendly!"
616,Bdx50dIaY5ceiYoLuajgjw,1,Just ordered a Cobb salad from this place and I have to say it's by far the worse food I've ever had in my culinary life.
616,Bdx50dIaY5ceiYoLuajgjw,1,"Canned spoiled corn, canned diced tomatoes and bagged microwave bacon with a couple pieces of cardboard grilled chicken."
616,Bdx50dIaY5ceiYoLuajgjw,1,I wasn't expecting much because let's be real it's BurgerPalace but this is beyond what's considered or passes for food.
616,Bdx50dIaY5ceiYoLuajgjw,1,I'm probably going to throw up tonight after a couple bites of this and hopefully a club soda can settle my stomach!
616,Bdx50dIaY5ceiYoLuajgjw,1,Good luck to you if you venture here.
616,Bdx50dIaY5ceiYoLuajgjw,1,Staff seemed nice so maybe just stick to the bar!!
616,Bdx50dIaY5ceiYoLuajgjw,1,Don't think they can ruin a bottled beer but hey stranger things have happened
617,XFzTqoWiCnSmYSXaJi7SHQ,5,Really great food at a really decent price.
617,XFzTqoWiCnSmYSXaJi7SHQ,5,A great salad bar.
617,XFzTqoWiCnSmYSXaJi7SHQ,5,"Terrific burgers, ribs, chicken and seafood."
617,XFzTqoWiCnSmYSXaJi7SHQ,5,I've paid much more at other establishments and the quality of the food was not even close.
617,XFzTqoWiCnSmYSXaJi7SHQ,5, 
617,XFzTqoWiCnSmYSXaJi7SHQ,5,Ask for Katherine ... great at her job and has a terrific personality.
618,7V_kLjaZQgyV4iwj4Sa_uA,5,"I'm biased because this place is right by my house, but I really like it!"
618,7V_kLjaZQgyV4iwj4Sa_uA,5,"It's never super crowded, the bartenders are nice, and the drinks are cheap."
618,7V_kLjaZQgyV4iwj4Sa_uA,5,"They also host live music every now and then, which is super fun."
618,7V_kLjaZQgyV4iwj4Sa_uA,5,"Definitely a hole-in-the-wall-type dive bar, and it does its job well."
619,s7800kAdNf-4qzNGzYaI5A,5,crispy pepperoni pizza that hits harder than ray ricefriendly staff ! great prices !
620,XYfQeYdWaPwtZMnAXWM_9g,5,"I absolutely love Ruby's, I was reading the reviews on how this place doesn't have 5 stars and most of the bad reviews are from 4-8+ years ago, it is amazingly cheap, the pizza is great, the people are kind, we get it a few times a week and we absolutely love it"
621,E14At1sUyBkH_mKa19HHmQ,5,This bar is amazing!!
621,E14At1sUyBkH_mKa19HHmQ,5,The nicest employees who will go out of their way to make their costumers happy.
621,E14At1sUyBkH_mKa19HHmQ,5,"It is very easy as a bartender to be rude, but these people rock!!!!"
621,E14At1sUyBkH_mKa19HHmQ,5,"Strong drinks, awesome environment, and great pizza!!"
621,E14At1sUyBkH_mKa19HHmQ,5,Highly recommend.
622,VrmhoCjzcbdxvfyDlzdnYQ,4,Pizza isn't half bad.
622,VrmhoCjzcbdxvfyDlzdnYQ,4,Good price for what you get.
622,VrmhoCjzcbdxvfyDlzdnYQ,4,Bar was clean.
622,VrmhoCjzcbdxvfyDlzdnYQ,4,Great local joint and a nice patio.
623,y5tNvho6_DTovNgSR2-bKQ,5,Been a longtime since I've been here...
623,y5tNvho6_DTovNgSR2-bKQ,5,My bad!Wow.
623,y5tNvho6_DTovNgSR2-bKQ,5,Just finished eating in the Lincoln Nebraska restaurant Fantastic ( way better than brilliant) service from our server !
623,y5tNvho6_DTovNgSR2-bKQ,5,Richard.
623,y5tNvho6_DTovNgSR2-bKQ,5,Food easy great.
623,y5tNvho6_DTovNgSR2-bKQ,5,Nice local beer.
623,y5tNvho6_DTovNgSR2-bKQ,5,Overall lovely experience!Thanks
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,It was late and my girlfriend and I needed.
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,We came to BurgerPalace and saw a sign saying we needed to wait for a server to seat us.
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,As we were waiting we watch an employee we assume is off the clock filling a ToGo box full of food from the salad bar.
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,We figured she is off the clock and just trying to leave.
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2, 
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,Approximately 10 minutes go by until someone comes out and notices us and asks us to wait until she has found a section that was open.
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,She found a small booth right next to a party of 9 people.
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,The booth was still dirty so we had to wait for the worker to clean the booth.
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,There was nobody else in the restaurant but it seemed important that we sit next to the party of 9...
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,We sit down and Jennifer was our server.
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,"We had come in an hour before close, but now it felt closer so we try to decide and order fast."
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,My girlfriend orders coconut shrimp and the endless salad bar.
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,Our server comes to take our order and right as my girlfriend orders the salad bar...
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,The employee that we thought had clocked off and filled her box with food came out and started tearing the salad bar down.
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,"She was still on the clock, she just didn't care that we were standing there waiting."
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,My girlfriend speaks up a little bit louder and confirms that we could get the salad bar.
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,Jennifer said that's not a problem.
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,I also ordered the salad bar and the ribeye steak with the bourbon chicken mashed potatoes and broccoli.
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,"Jennifer goes to grab our drinks, and tells us we can go start on the salad bar."
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,"We stand up and see that there are no serving spoons, tongs, no plates, and the lettuce is gone."
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,Jennifer comes back with our drinks and we ask if we can still get salad because there are no utensils.
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,Jennifer goes back into the kitchen to confront the other worker and finally the other employee comes out with the plates...
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,Slowly goes back into the kitchen and comes back out with the lettuce...
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,Slowly goes back into the kitchen and brings out one spoon and sticks it in the ranch.
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,She disappears into the kitchen and does not come back out.
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,Jennifer comes to check on us and sees we haven't eaten yet.
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,The girl had not brought the tongs and spoons so there was no way to serve ourselves.
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,"Jennifer apologizes again, goes in the kitchen, grabs a bunch of utensils and asks us what we would like to have on the salad bar to be sure we can grab whatever we would like."
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,My girlfriend and I grab two plates and fill the plates with whatever we can have because we know there was not going to be a second trip.
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,Everything we eat from the salad bar tasted like it was soaked in ham juice.
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,Our food comes.
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,"The steak that I ate wasn't the best, but my girlfriend enjoyed my french fries."
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,"We tipped Jennifer because we know how hard it is to be a server, but particularly a server who is covering for a lack of leadership."
624,mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,I do not think we will be going back there anytime soon.
625,wbcHeN1hd1qKkcIoH9ZmHw,1,The waitress was good the chicken was burnt we could here the cook yelling and cussing at someone in the kitchen then the cook came out to tell us he was out of mashed potatoes but if we wanted them he could mash up some damn potatoes after he bakes them.
625,wbcHeN1hd1qKkcIoH9ZmHw,1,Again the waitress was very good and polite.
625,wbcHeN1hd1qKkcIoH9ZmHw,1,But would never go back.
626,jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,My family and I visitation met for lunch here on Saturday.
626,jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,There were 9 of us.
626,jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,We arrived after 1 so the restaurant was not very busy.
626,jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,It took a long time to get the waiters attention to get menus.
626,jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,He gave us menus a and left.
626,jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,We had to wait for prolong period of time to ask him to take our drink orders and out lunch order.
626,jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,We had find him and get his attention to get the 3 orders from the bar.
626,jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,We only recieved 2 of the 3.
626,jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,We could see drinks at the bar so we sent him back.
626,jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,He grabbed the wrong one.
626,jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,"When he bought out the meals, it was in 3 to 5 minute increments."
626,jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,He forgot to submit two of the meals.
626,jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1, They didnt get their meals until everyone else was finished.
626,jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,The food was average quality.
626,jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,The salad bar was not well stocked.
626,jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,Several empty or partially empty dishes.
626,jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,No apologies from the waiter.
626,jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,He was not trained well.
626,jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,The forgotten meals were not comped nor was the screwed up drink orders.
626,jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,We will not be back
627,7EB8i8t-dITPos4Hb3jcUQ,1,This place was terrible.
627,7EB8i8t-dITPos4Hb3jcUQ,1,it should probably shut down terrible.
627,7EB8i8t-dITPos4Hb3jcUQ,1,Food was bad and the service was bad.
627,7EB8i8t-dITPos4Hb3jcUQ,1,It use to be a nice place.
627,7EB8i8t-dITPos4Hb3jcUQ,1,I'd rather eat at Mc. Donald's than this place.
628,5WHK7qlpdPj3I940gLFZsg,4,Mac 'N Cheeseburger:
628,5WHK7qlpdPj3I940gLFZsg,4,I've actually never been to a BurgerPalace before.
628,5WHK7qlpdPj3I940gLFZsg,4,A couple weeks ago I saw an ad for this limited time item (while at the gym of all places) and was hooked.
628,5WHK7qlpdPj3I940gLFZsg,4,"The cheeseburger is topped with enormous macaroni noodles, an exceptionally creamy cheese sauce, bacon bits, and I believe there was an actual slice of cheese on the beef patty."
628,5WHK7qlpdPj3I940gLFZsg,4,"Another important note is the bun was soft, chewy, and was in proportion with the size of the patty (it sucks when the meat to bun ratio is off)."
628,5WHK7qlpdPj3I940gLFZsg,4,"I recommend picking up this item before it's gone, but it would be nice if it was made a permanent feature on the menu.  Doughboy approved!  (Doughboy_Food_Reviews)"
629,ic48vVW-DitCTIlbtYijmQ,2,Food probably 4 star but the service ruined our experience.
629,ic48vVW-DitCTIlbtYijmQ,2,"Quick seating, pretty small place but clean."
629,ic48vVW-DitCTIlbtYijmQ,2,"Took at least 10 mins to get helped, drinks came out quick and took our meal order, then poof disappeared for 45?"
629,ic48vVW-DitCTIlbtYijmQ,2,Mins till bill time.
629,ic48vVW-DitCTIlbtYijmQ,2,"Kitchen staff delivered food and that's it, no checking on meal, drink refills, zero contact."
629,ic48vVW-DitCTIlbtYijmQ,2,"Bourbon Salmon was nicely done, and the zucchini was cooked through properly, even the rice was good."
629,ic48vVW-DitCTIlbtYijmQ,2,Burger was average but came with large order of fries.
629,ic48vVW-DitCTIlbtYijmQ,2,No dessert because it was never offered.
630,KXtM1NE2wRhy8OoZ7BsqsA,4,Came here to fulfill our salad craving.
630,KXtM1NE2wRhy8OoZ7BsqsA,4,"The Good:The salad bar was stocked, clean and had lots of great options."
630,KXtM1NE2wRhy8OoZ7BsqsA,4,Our server seemed new but did a terrific job as wellThe Bad:We ordered a drink for $2 and were charged $4.25.
630,KXtM1NE2wRhy8OoZ7BsqsA,4,It took 10 minutes to figure it out and get our bill correctedThe
630,KXtM1NE2wRhy8OoZ7BsqsA,4,Ugly Truth:
630,KXtM1NE2wRhy8OoZ7BsqsA,4,"It was a nice location with great service, clean atmosphere and a yummy salad bar."
630,KXtM1NE2wRhy8OoZ7BsqsA,4,We liked it here and will return for more when our cravings for salad get ot of control lol
631,wMfiPuLNfZnys-shVLJq4A,2,I ordered a medium rare ribeye.
631,wMfiPuLNfZnys-shVLJq4A,2,I should have known better.
631,wMfiPuLNfZnys-shVLJq4A,2,I could tell the meat quality was poor so there was no use asking for a new steak when it came out medium well.
631,wMfiPuLNfZnys-shVLJq4A,2," My wife' said her sandwich was good, but chicken is chicken."
631,wMfiPuLNfZnys-shVLJq4A,2,Restaurants should learn to only offer food they are good at making.
632,G3cOWcr09k9osHpyEQ4TUQ,4,Since losing our BurgerPalace in Council Bluffs Iowa we decided to stop in and have our salad bar buffet.
632,G3cOWcr09k9osHpyEQ4TUQ,4,It was a nice refreshing meal on an over 100 degree day.
632,G3cOWcr09k9osHpyEQ4TUQ,4,"I am never disappointed in the options on the salad bar BUT today I'm not sure what it was but both myself and my husband got very sick to our stomachs directly after we ate, I actually got sick before we left."
632,G3cOWcr09k9osHpyEQ4TUQ,4,We will still return in the future because maybe it was just a fluke.
632,G3cOWcr09k9osHpyEQ4TUQ,4,Thank you for continuing the salad bar options when many other places have discontinued them..
633,4dtFnEdydMgltAwviVMo7A,5,"There was this very nice young lady named Hannah when I walked in, she was a wonderful hostess and got us scheduled and right where we needed to be, she was  a great smiling face to walk Into, the food was quite good, and the servers were fast, respectful, kind, and funny!"
633,4dtFnEdydMgltAwviVMo7A,5,Great experience!
634,L2qIDZvtI1AqtT5aWlsy3A,4,Picked up a full rack of baby back ribs in Urbandale  and it tasted great.
634,L2qIDZvtI1AqtT5aWlsy3A,4,Recommend asking for extra sauce on the side.
635,k-XI10hlhCUo1KGk5ij41g,3,It took close to 30 minutes to get our food and I continue to wait on the server to bring the bill.
635,k-XI10hlhCUo1KGk5ij41g,3,"If the server was friendly, we probably wouldn't have been so frustrated."
636,_LRBDvexP6SI2KtYeC8jSA,4,"The food has always been very good, at times excellent."
636,_LRBDvexP6SI2KtYeC8jSA,4,"Servers tend to be knowledgeable and polite, and the venue is very pleasant."
636,_LRBDvexP6SI2KtYeC8jSA,4,We go there several times a year.
636,_LRBDvexP6SI2KtYeC8jSA,4,I would give 4.5 stars if I could.
637,mmqAKHg-5ztP6sFtsB3FRQ,1,The food wasn't good... but what was most memorable was the General Manager.
637,mmqAKHg-5ztP6sFtsB3FRQ,1,The GM was initially very friendly until my party requested another table away from two infants.
637,mmqAKHg-5ztP6sFtsB3FRQ,1,The minor inconvenience of requesting a different table brought out a rudeness I haven't witnessed elsewhere.
637,mmqAKHg-5ztP6sFtsB3FRQ,1,"After our meal was delivered, my party was able to witness the GM arguing very loudly with an upset customer on the phone."
637,mmqAKHg-5ztP6sFtsB3FRQ,1,Evidently the GM thought their title and behavior was impressive as he projected his voice for the entire establishment to hear and reiterated his title.
637,mmqAKHg-5ztP6sFtsB3FRQ,1,At the end of our meal I tipped the server extremely well and told him that his man-child of a boss was surely costing him tips at other tables and encouraged them to quit as they deserve to work for an adult.
638,xldzwyZ9hbjq78vXgRN9Sw,1,This place sucks.
638,xldzwyZ9hbjq78vXgRN9Sw,1, It's like an Applebee's but more expensive for shit food.
638,xldzwyZ9hbjq78vXgRN9Sw,1,Didn't get a refill on my tea.
638,xldzwyZ9hbjq78vXgRN9Sw,1,Nobody checks led on us.
638,xldzwyZ9hbjq78vXgRN9Sw,1,Never going back.
638,xldzwyZ9hbjq78vXgRN9Sw,1,Place is garbage.
639,tiGwDMczIXuU_yXenlX43g,1,Doesn't pick up when you call to place an order.
639,tiGwDMczIXuU_yXenlX43g,1,How do they stay in business?
639,tiGwDMczIXuU_yXenlX43g,1,Ordering someplace else I guess.
640,VObk8mYt-qwPBifCERSVlw,1,These people had the nerve to serve me raw fish and one sided cooked shrimp I ordered via GrubHub I called and spoke to somebody who claims they spoke to the manager who seem more concerned with me getting my money via GrubHub then them having a continued customer because they were getting ready to close I have never had a problem with my food before but I know I will never spend my $30 at this place again due to the terrible customer service.
640,VObk8mYt-qwPBifCERSVlw,1,And even though they served me raw fish I just asked if I could just get my food remade - The lady over the phone replied who's going to bring it to you i'm not going to bring it to you ( keep in mind I never asked her to do so ) I replied I could pick up it up if it was remade she said no we are closed!
640,VObk8mYt-qwPBifCERSVlw,1,-NEVER A FUCKING GAIN !
641,0nCsTreEZI6u1PtCOa_gFA,5,Had a late dinner there.
641,0nCsTreEZI6u1PtCOa_gFA,5,The staff was friendly and working hard.
641,0nCsTreEZI6u1PtCOa_gFA,5, 
641,0nCsTreEZI6u1PtCOa_gFA,5,Had the rib-eye and it was good.
641,0nCsTreEZI6u1PtCOa_gFA,5,Will visit again.
642,TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3,We came on a Wednesday to use a Buy One Get One coupon.
642,TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3,The restaurant was very clean and not crowded so we were seated right away.
642,TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3,Service was good overall as our waitress hustled as she was the only one on this dinner shift likely the result of the difficult times for restaurants to find help.
642,TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3, I liked that the salad bar was open during the pandemic and masks and gloves were required at the salad bar (disposable gloves provided) which worked well.
642,TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3,"Salad bar was decent, nothing remarkable or bad for that matter."
642,TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3,Ranch dressing was watery.
642,TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3," I had a full rack Of ribs, wanted onion rings but they were out so had fries and zucchini."
642,TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3,"The ribs were ""OK"" and what I expected."
642,TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3,On the dry side but slathered with bbq sauce to compensate and meat easily came off the bone.
642,TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3,Zucchini was excellent and piping hot fries were just ok - could have been hotter and less soggy.
642,TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3,She had Asiago chicken which was super cheesy and good.
642,TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3,Chicken was very tender and same sides I had.
642,TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3,It was a decent meal and value (with 1 free entree) but at full price I may have been slightly dissatisfied.
642,TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3,I wish you could substitute salad bar for a side with a $2 or $3 up-charge versus having to buy for $5 as we each had 1 not so big salad.
642,TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3,Overall we enjoyed the meal.
643,qQ9NHH2R_I9v9DdnlO_JmA,1,Not open their published hours.
643,qQ9NHH2R_I9v9DdnlO_JmA,1,Extremely rude and aggressive manager.
643,qQ9NHH2R_I9v9DdnlO_JmA,1,Avoid this place!
644,1wLIieJD6luSTh7LDQNZog,3,"While staying in the area for a work project, there weren't very many options for food past 8PM."
644,1wLIieJD6luSTh7LDQNZog,3,This BurgerPalace is located at a good spot and is walking distance from a couple of the hotels in the area.
644,1wLIieJD6luSTh7LDQNZog,3,"The setup is just as you would expect- pick up area and bar on one side, sit-down tables on the other."
644,1wLIieJD6luSTh7LDQNZog,3,There are a few tv's around to watch the game in the bar area.
644,1wLIieJD6luSTh7LDQNZog,3,Food is standard faire for this establishment.
644,1wLIieJD6luSTh7LDQNZog,3,One night I had a burger and the next a crispy chicken sandwich.
644,1wLIieJD6luSTh7LDQNZog,3,"Both were good the presentation was nice and the person cooking the food did a good job with ""medium-rare""."
644,1wLIieJD6luSTh7LDQNZog,3,The bartender on two nights was Matt and he certainly was a positive on my visits.
644,1wLIieJD6luSTh7LDQNZog,3,Good attitude and a pleasure to be around.
644,1wLIieJD6luSTh7LDQNZog,3,Although it was past 9PM he still had to clean and let those of us who were still eating finish our meals uninterrupted and didn't rush anyone out the door.
645,pbo80LmyjNIcxCyhudORZA,1,Had food ordered and delivered at work.
645,pbo80LmyjNIcxCyhudORZA,1,As soon as I started to take the first cut into my chicken I saw a black curly hair.
645,pbo80LmyjNIcxCyhudORZA,1,When I called I spoke with Fay.
645,pbo80LmyjNIcxCyhudORZA,1,She didn't even allow me to continue my sentence before apologizing and then proceeded to say they couldn't refund because it was through uber Eats.
645,pbo80LmyjNIcxCyhudORZA,1,"Problem other than the hair is, I didn't ask for a refund."
645,pbo80LmyjNIcxCyhudORZA,1,I was hungry and wanted the food that was ordered and paid for.
645,pbo80LmyjNIcxCyhudORZA,1,She blew me off because she said I'd have to call Uber again and have them deliver.
645,pbo80LmyjNIcxCyhudORZA,1,What type of customer service is that!?
645,pbo80LmyjNIcxCyhudORZA,1,"She was completely rude, disrespectful and showed no real empathy at all."
646,s0CsNWJbvDET4lfVOrYMNw,5,I'm not sure why this restaurant has been rated so poorly.
646,s0CsNWJbvDET4lfVOrYMNw,5," I'm rather picky, and we usually get BurgerPalace delivered once a week."
646,s0CsNWJbvDET4lfVOrYMNw,5," Their ribs are just-as-good-as Bear's, if not BETTER!  "
646,s0CsNWJbvDET4lfVOrYMNw,5,Chicken strips and fried shrimp are delicious (last time I got their ribs-chicken & shrimp meal and was soooo happy.  We have ordered the artichoke dip and tater tots a few times; always good.
646,s0CsNWJbvDET4lfVOrYMNw,5, 
646,s0CsNWJbvDET4lfVOrYMNw,5,"I can't recommend their grilled zucchini enough; I usually choose it for both of my 2 sides, which makes my ribs a keto friendly meal.  "
646,s0CsNWJbvDET4lfVOrYMNw,5,They're dinner salad is huge and fresh.
646,s0CsNWJbvDET4lfVOrYMNw,5, I love their cheesecake!
646,s0CsNWJbvDET4lfVOrYMNw,5," I don't think they make it (it arrived half frozen last time), but it is amazing!"
646,s0CsNWJbvDET4lfVOrYMNw,5, Burgers are great.
646,s0CsNWJbvDET4lfVOrYMNw,5, My kids like the chicken & broccoli alfredo pasta.
647,53Uk1kulqfH-NpGHJt_InA,5,Fantastic service and food in light of these trying times.
647,53Uk1kulqfH-NpGHJt_InA,5,Take out only during the Covid-19 crisis.
647,53Uk1kulqfH-NpGHJt_InA,5,"Everyone did such a wonderful job with my meal--hot, fresh, and fast."
647,53Uk1kulqfH-NpGHJt_InA,5,I could not have asked for anything more.
647,53Uk1kulqfH-NpGHJt_InA,5,Great job everyone!
648,xK2hRZmtuLNIvjwZKWBIEg,3,We were getting take-out salad bar from BurgerPalace sometimes as much as twice a week over the summer.
648,xK2hRZmtuLNIvjwZKWBIEg,3,"if you join their email club you get a lot of great promos and deals and to be honest, we loved their salad bar!"
648,xK2hRZmtuLNIvjwZKWBIEg,3,We moved to CT from CA where we had MANY build your own salad restaurants and we miss that!
648,xK2hRZmtuLNIvjwZKWBIEg,3,So finding BurgerPalace salad bar was a win for us.
648,xK2hRZmtuLNIvjwZKWBIEg,3,"However, starting in the fall, we realized the quality of the salad bar items, how often they would refill (we could wait for 10-15 minutes after asking to get more lettuce because it was empty), and the fact that they would run out of items often (as early as 5PM on a weekday) really has discouraged us from returning."
648,xK2hRZmtuLNIvjwZKWBIEg,3,We have tried to go back once or twice but it's been disappointing each time.
649,s6CMbyNpuqgwLoVvwQpmqQ,3,The food here is decent but way too overpriced for what it's worth.
649,s6CMbyNpuqgwLoVvwQpmqQ,3,I like the coconut shrimp and the chicken sandwich here but they are super greasy and dripping in oil.
649,s6CMbyNpuqgwLoVvwQpmqQ,3,The peach sangria from here is yummy though and was much more affordable than the food here.
649,s6CMbyNpuqgwLoVvwQpmqQ,3,This is definitely not the place to go if you're on a budget but it's okay if you're craving American food once in awhile.
650,dGgvb0X8JcDaSygj6zbbHw,5,"The waiter Brian., and the Manager Cristy are awesome , Brought my sister in law here for lunch for her 60th birthday, food was excellent, restaurant was very clean, salad bar all fresh Will def be back"
651,og3Ztw6-S_hgriv7vP0tmw,1,"Sadly, this used to be my favorite restaurant."
651,og3Ztw6-S_hgriv7vP0tmw,1," The last two visits though, have soured me to the restaurant."
651,og3Ztw6-S_hgriv7vP0tmw,1," Last week, eating in, our baked potatoes were slathered in sour cream, despite being ordered without and the to go order we placed with our dine in order was never sent to the kitchen."
651,og3Ztw6-S_hgriv7vP0tmw,1,"Today, I called in an order."
651,og3Ztw6-S_hgriv7vP0tmw,1," Before ordering, gave the coupon code to the person answering the phone and asked a specific question about the order and  based on the server's reply - placed my order."
651,og3Ztw6-S_hgriv7vP0tmw,1," When I arrived to pick it up, the bill was 16% higher than what it should have been."
651,og3Ztw6-S_hgriv7vP0tmw,1,"When questioned, the manager on duty said, the coupon couldn't be used."
651,og3Ztw6-S_hgriv7vP0tmw,1, She apologized and said there was nothing she could do.
651,og3Ztw6-S_hgriv7vP0tmw,1, I explained that I asked specifically when I placed the order and she responded that the server should have asked her before saying yes.
651,og3Ztw6-S_hgriv7vP0tmw,1,"   I could have left the food, but not a fan of wasting, paid the higher price and left."
651,og3Ztw6-S_hgriv7vP0tmw,1, Since when can a manager not make an order right?
651,og3Ztw6-S_hgriv7vP0tmw,1, I guess you have to ask a manager when ordering because apparently the servers don't have the training - or support of their supervisors.
652,5o-fmEjAwiuLHETxyrlqWQ,1,"Wish I could give 0 stars!I usually don't do reviews, but this experience was ridiculous!"
652,5o-fmEjAwiuLHETxyrlqWQ,1,"Arrived at 1:05 pm, seated promptly."
652,5o-fmEjAwiuLHETxyrlqWQ,1,Ordered within 5 minutes of being seated.
652,5o-fmEjAwiuLHETxyrlqWQ,1,Food (3 people in our party; 2 ordered pasta & 1 ordered a burger) arrived at 1:57 pm.
652,5o-fmEjAwiuLHETxyrlqWQ,1,52 minutes to get pasta & a burger!
652,5o-fmEjAwiuLHETxyrlqWQ,1,"The burger had a gooey, disintegrating bottom bun, and the side of fries portion looked like it was a toddler's meal."
652,5o-fmEjAwiuLHETxyrlqWQ,1,"I asked for more fries, which were brought, but were room temperature."
652,5o-fmEjAwiuLHETxyrlqWQ,1,"Needless to say, the fries weren't eaten."
652,5o-fmEjAwiuLHETxyrlqWQ,1,"The manager heard me say we had been waiting almost an hour for our food (she had helped the waitress deliver our food), but no apology or discount was offered."
652,5o-fmEjAwiuLHETxyrlqWQ,1,"By the way, none of the  toilets in the women's bathroom flush properly."
652,5o-fmEjAwiuLHETxyrlqWQ,1,"In an attempt to use one that didn't have ""stuff"" in it from a previous  person, I looked at all of them, proceed to flush all of them and none of them flush everything done."
652,5o-fmEjAwiuLHETxyrlqWQ,1,Disgusting!
652,5o-fmEjAwiuLHETxyrlqWQ,1,Will never go back!
653,bA9PqfBQ99dws9dOoPalWQ,5,"Great salad bar, always friendly staff &"
653,bA9PqfBQ99dws9dOoPalWQ,5,WOW THE BEST SALMON AROUND!!!
653,bA9PqfBQ99dws9dOoPalWQ,5,They were quick & looked short handed but they were nice!
654,ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,June 1 my friend and I went specifically to have the garden bar.
654,ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,  Unfortunately it was not available.
654,ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,  Several people walked in and back out for the same reason.
654,ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,  My friend asked to speak to the manager.
654,ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3, He came by And introduced himself.
654,ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,  He blamed lack of staff for not having the bar.
654,ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,  He was there to hire staff Only.
654,ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,  Supposedly he worded 19 hours.
654,ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,  I'm assuming he was wanting some sympathy but he was talking to two self employed women that have worked hard.
654,ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,  I think he could have come up with a solution to the problem.
654,ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3," In  nineteen hours he could have the lettuce cut up, veggies,    But all we heard was blame to the staff."
654,ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,    If you are the manager wouldn't you offer customers a discount or something instead of letting them walk out.?
654,ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,   Why is there a turnover at the restaurant?
654,ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,  They are always hiring new staff.
654,ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,  Something isn't right Or they wouldn't quit.
654,ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3, Could it be the manager doesn't respect his staff!
654,ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,  He definitely isn't a team player or he would have done more  instead of blaming the staff.
654,ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,  Brianna and Tamara are definitely team players.
654,ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,  They are great with customers and providing service.
654,ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,  They are the reasons I'm giving a few stars.
654,ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,  If it wasn't for them it would be zero stars.
655,3D4FaCVfVBBhi-ZqcNauWg,2,"I went to the College Drive location in Suffolk, VA!"
655,3D4FaCVfVBBhi-ZqcNauWg,2,We have been to this location many times because my husband loves the salad bar.
655,3D4FaCVfVBBhi-ZqcNauWg,2,We ordered to go this time 2 of the TEX MEX Steak Fajitas they have been advertising.
655,3D4FaCVfVBBhi-ZqcNauWg,2,When I got home with my order 1) the picture advertised and what I received didn't even come close to the same!
655,3D4FaCVfVBBhi-ZqcNauWg,2,2) the black beans and rice were left out of both entrees completely!
655,3D4FaCVfVBBhi-ZqcNauWg,2,I normally check my order before I leave but the bag was tied so tight I didn't this time.
655,3D4FaCVfVBBhi-ZqcNauWg,2, I made numerous attempts to call the restaurant and the phone was never answered!
655,3D4FaCVfVBBhi-ZqcNauWg,2,I understand staffing is a problem in most restaurants currently so I made a 2nd trip back to the restaurant to pick up the omitted part of my order!
655,3D4FaCVfVBBhi-ZqcNauWg,2,The amount of the 2 sides I received was not worth the $4.59 per gal. of gas it cost to make that 2nd trip!
655,3D4FaCVfVBBhi-ZqcNauWg,2,My biggest regret was not taking a pic. of MY order to show a comparison to what was advertised for $12.99.
655,3D4FaCVfVBBhi-ZqcNauWg,2, 
655,3D4FaCVfVBBhi-ZqcNauWg,2,Taco Bell would have been a better choice and much cheaper!
656,bzZhc9QtJdi1k1ZxXCCj0w,1,arrived with a party of 11.
656,bzZhc9QtJdi1k1ZxXCCj0w,1,Offered to be split up however was told by wait staff to wait outside & theyll push tables together.
656,bzZhc9QtJdi1k1ZxXCCj0w,1,Waited over 20min in entry however no one got our tables.
656,bzZhc9QtJdi1k1ZxXCCj0w,1,Now waiting over an hour for our food.
656,bzZhc9QtJdi1k1ZxXCCj0w,1,Only 3 other tables in seating area.
656,bzZhc9QtJdi1k1ZxXCCj0w,1,Do not recommend.
657,kjwZB06ESKx92Syl_G_ZTg,4,Great salmon and shrimp Parmesan meals.
657,kjwZB06ESKx92Syl_G_ZTg,4,Service was great and the salad bar was delicious too.
658,HOzK2v_wRCx4sRFXT-1FEw,1,We stayed at the adjacent Quality Inn and walked over to the BurgerPalace  
658,HOzK2v_wRCx4sRFXT-1FEw,1,The oversized banner for a fajita special lured me to try them.
658,HOzK2v_wRCx4sRFXT-1FEw,1, 
658,HOzK2v_wRCx4sRFXT-1FEw,1,Big mistake.
658,HOzK2v_wRCx4sRFXT-1FEw,1,These were the absolutely worst fajitas I have ever had.
658,HOzK2v_wRCx4sRFXT-1FEw,1," Room temperature golfball sized clumps of rice, barely warm fajitas and bowl of black beans, but the kicker was this red mass of barely warm peppers aside the otherwise OK pieces of chicken."
658,HOzK2v_wRCx4sRFXT-1FEw,1," So hungry, I ate it."
658,HOzK2v_wRCx4sRFXT-1FEw,1," Not distasteful or safety-suspect, but just room temperature mess."
658,HOzK2v_wRCx4sRFXT-1FEw,1,"The waitress was nice and attentive; she told the manager of my experience and he came by and expressed his apologies, giving me appetizer coupons."
658,HOzK2v_wRCx4sRFXT-1FEw,1, 
658,HOzK2v_wRCx4sRFXT-1FEw,1,I would have more appreciated them covering the tab for the $6 bottled Coronas.
658,HOzK2v_wRCx4sRFXT-1FEw,1,Never again.
659,nXNj4yvxnQ6B4N46sEvQ5Q,4,Very good Philly cheesesteak sandwich.
659,nXNj4yvxnQ6B4N46sEvQ5Q,4,It even came with fries.
659,nXNj4yvxnQ6B4N46sEvQ5Q,4,We got it for takeout.
659,nXNj4yvxnQ6B4N46sEvQ5Q,4,Lots of food for reasonable price.
660,dMjN_X3zUO-pzACMpzZmgQ,2,Where to begin...
660,dMjN_X3zUO-pzACMpzZmgQ,2,"first off, I had to wait about 10 minutes just to have the waitress come to the table."
660,dMjN_X3zUO-pzACMpzZmgQ,2,It was not busy at all.
660,dMjN_X3zUO-pzACMpzZmgQ,2,When she did show up she was friendly and helpful.
660,dMjN_X3zUO-pzACMpzZmgQ,2,"I ordered a Salmon with Mac and cheese and fries on the side, Cheese sticks and the salad bar."
660,dMjN_X3zUO-pzACMpzZmgQ,2,"When I got to the salad bar, the lettuce was brown."
660,dMjN_X3zUO-pzACMpzZmgQ,2,I told the waitress not sure if they fixed it.
660,dMjN_X3zUO-pzACMpzZmgQ,2,When I got the cheese sticks they were actually not bad at all.
660,dMjN_X3zUO-pzACMpzZmgQ,2,"Then to the main course, the fish was ok, it was edible.(probably me, I really don't get fish that often, but something new)The"
660,dMjN_X3zUO-pzACMpzZmgQ,2,"mac and cheese just had no taste, too bland."
660,dMjN_X3zUO-pzACMpzZmgQ,2,"To top it all off, it was a little pricey for what I got."
660,dMjN_X3zUO-pzACMpzZmgQ,2,And they don't do a First Responder discount.
660,dMjN_X3zUO-pzACMpzZmgQ,2,"At least for me, I won't be back."
661,rafaGmJu0VIo35pUkGBr6Q,1,Placed an order online for pickup.
661,rafaGmJu0VIo35pUkGBr6Q,1,Picked up my order and the waitress who was helping me was wonderful.
661,rafaGmJu0VIo35pUkGBr6Q,1,Extremely friendly.
661,rafaGmJu0VIo35pUkGBr6Q,1,"Sadly, that's the only good thing about it."
661,rafaGmJu0VIo35pUkGBr6Q,1,"I added the salad bar for 4.99, and I understand that some items may not be available due to covid however, no croutons, bacon bits, or eggs (that I noticed)."
661,rafaGmJu0VIo35pUkGBr6Q,1,"The lettuce was brown, the vegetables were dry, the pasta salads and such were old and dried out."
661,rafaGmJu0VIo35pUkGBr6Q,1,Got to my hotel (less than a mile away) and sat down to eat and my mashed potatoes were ICE COLD.
661,rafaGmJu0VIo35pUkGBr6Q,1,The steak was undercooked and was very gray (no sear at all).
662,B8sMNINldyIMohrSfiJE-g,4,"I picked up a dinner of grilled salmon, baked potato, and aside salad."
662,B8sMNINldyIMohrSfiJE-g,4,The good news us that the food was good.
662,B8sMNINldyIMohrSfiJE-g,4,"The bad news is that-- despite not being busy-- I had to wait more than 10 minutes more than I was told, and I was not given any plastic utensils or napkins."
662,B8sMNINldyIMohrSfiJE-g,4,I got the vibe that management was taking the day off.
663,B5dg0xdhjcm3yrGYHSWo7Q,1,This place is HORRIBLE!!!
663,B5dg0xdhjcm3yrGYHSWo7Q,1,Their services is terrible and they are so rude to their employees.
663,B5dg0xdhjcm3yrGYHSWo7Q,1,They will ask thier employees to come in when no one is at the restaurant and then tell them they can go home early but won't pay them for the time they work.
663,B5dg0xdhjcm3yrGYHSWo7Q,1,I highly highly do not recommend this restaurant.
663,B5dg0xdhjcm3yrGYHSWo7Q,1,If I could give them a negative I would.
663,B5dg0xdhjcm3yrGYHSWo7Q,1,Again highly highly DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!
664,S6zrd2Sp8S91J-ZLd48fPA,2,food is pretty lousy and expensive but the beer on tap is cold and makes you sort of overlook it...
664,S6zrd2Sp8S91J-ZLd48fPA,2,bartender was friendly.
664,S6zrd2Sp8S91J-ZLd48fPA,2," Specifically I'm talking about an appetizer app which was way too salty and forget getting the steak, it's just a cheap cut filled with fat."
665,6CAaqfd3Bi93cLv5xLxmfg,2,Pretty terrible experience overall.
665,6CAaqfd3Bi93cLv5xLxmfg,2,Waiter (John?) was nice but place was heavily understaffed.
665,6CAaqfd3Bi93cLv5xLxmfg,2,He gave me 3 Coke Zero refills but it tasted really off and diluted and gross.
665,6CAaqfd3Bi93cLv5xLxmfg,2,I ordered ribeye steak medium well and it was super well done and tough.
665,6CAaqfd3Bi93cLv5xLxmfg,2,Not worth the price.
665,6CAaqfd3Bi93cLv5xLxmfg,2,"My coworkers had nachos which were edible but not great, and tacos which were decent."
665,6CAaqfd3Bi93cLv5xLxmfg,2,Cheesecake was their saving grace.
665,6CAaqfd3Bi93cLv5xLxmfg,2,"Good size for the price, but nothing special flavor-wise."
665,6CAaqfd3Bi93cLv5xLxmfg,2,"Table was really really sticky, as well as under the chair."
665,6CAaqfd3Bi93cLv5xLxmfg,2,Even my plastic glass of Coke Zero was super sticky.
665,6CAaqfd3Bi93cLv5xLxmfg,2,The place needs to be cleaned up heavily.
665,6CAaqfd3Bi93cLv5xLxmfg,2,Would not come back.
665,6CAaqfd3Bi93cLv5xLxmfg,2,I regret coming here.
665,6CAaqfd3Bi93cLv5xLxmfg,2,Great waiter despite the bad service.
665,6CAaqfd3Bi93cLv5xLxmfg,2,Super subpar food.
665,6CAaqfd3Bi93cLv5xLxmfg,2,Pretty sad for my first time at a BurgerPalace Looks like it's BurgerPalace No-days moving forward.
665,6CAaqfd3Bi93cLv5xLxmfg,2,Not coming back.
665,6CAaqfd3Bi93cLv5xLxmfg,2,I left hungry and $100+ out of pocket.
665,6CAaqfd3Bi93cLv5xLxmfg,2,Terrible meal with great company.
666,I-XA5xwEfv8SX63YdbGLuQ,1,If I could give negative star count I would.
666,I-XA5xwEfv8SX63YdbGLuQ,1,"This was there worst service, the worst tasting good and slowest delivery EVER."
666,I-XA5xwEfv8SX63YdbGLuQ,1, 
666,I-XA5xwEfv8SX63YdbGLuQ,1,"I ordered Salmon, it wasn't cooked all the way through and the rice pilaf was dry and lacked flavor."
666,I-XA5xwEfv8SX63YdbGLuQ,1,Cost was not worth it.
666,I-XA5xwEfv8SX63YdbGLuQ,1,I will never order from this BurgerPalace again.
666,I-XA5xwEfv8SX63YdbGLuQ,1,Not worth it.
667,trUTs4tqJlaQzLtysUUa5A,4,Thank goodness this place is attached to the Marriott.
667,trUTs4tqJlaQzLtysUUa5A,4,It made my stay at the Marriott palatable.
667,trUTs4tqJlaQzLtysUUa5A,4,The food here is nothing to write home about.
667,trUTs4tqJlaQzLtysUUa5A,4,I wasn't expecting gourmet greatness and I certainly didn't get it.
667,trUTs4tqJlaQzLtysUUa5A,4,What I got was pub style food that tasted decent and went down easy with a few draft beers.
667,trUTs4tqJlaQzLtysUUa5A,4,The service is where this place shines.
667,trUTs4tqJlaQzLtysUUa5A,4,My bartender/server Jesse was outstanding.
667,trUTs4tqJlaQzLtysUUa5A,4,Quick with the refills and was able to steer me to some decent menu items.
667,trUTs4tqJlaQzLtysUUa5A,4,If you're looking for a cold drink and something to put in your stomach this pace fits the bill.
667,trUTs4tqJlaQzLtysUUa5A,4,**Note don't get the BBQ Chicken Nachos.
667,trUTs4tqJlaQzLtysUUa5A,4,They're nasty.
668,FJxfcjFcSSgeGtwjbxyuqg,5,So happy to have finally been able to eat at a BurgerPalace again.
668,FJxfcjFcSSgeGtwjbxyuqg,5,"They closed the locations near my home, but we were near this location and it was a hit!"
668,FJxfcjFcSSgeGtwjbxyuqg,5,"Our server, Jesse, was great!"
668,FJxfcjFcSSgeGtwjbxyuqg,5,He was spot on with our service and the salad bar was perfectly stocked.
668,FJxfcjFcSSgeGtwjbxyuqg,5,And those freshly made croutons were still warm and perfectly crunchy and soft at the same time.
668,FJxfcjFcSSgeGtwjbxyuqg,5,Can't wait to go back again!!!!!
669,77TbE-5ZupOL4RZjlElc1w,1,"Came here with my girlfriend because it was close to where we're staying, the outside fairly reflects the inside."
669,77TbE-5ZupOL4RZjlElc1w,1,"The two of us were sat after waiting for a few minutes, despite the restaurant being empty."
669,77TbE-5ZupOL4RZjlElc1w,1,No big deal.
669,77TbE-5ZupOL4RZjlElc1w,1,"The server becomes visibly upset when we asked for a booth, which was discomforting and confusing."
669,77TbE-5ZupOL4RZjlElc1w,1,"We waited for 15 minutes as other patrons arrived in small groups, we over heard the server seating them and taking their orders during this time."
669,77TbE-5ZupOL4RZjlElc1w,1,She never came back to our table and we eventually left after we decided not to wait any longer for the terrible service we would inevitably get.
669,77TbE-5ZupOL4RZjlElc1w,1,"Pretty terrible experience, shame we wasted time here."
669,77TbE-5ZupOL4RZjlElc1w,1,Hope everyone who works here finds happiness.
669,77TbE-5ZupOL4RZjlElc1w,1,1/10.
670,VaMEE4mNeFBJDTHv-cHcrw,5,Friendly attentive staff and great food !
670,VaMEE4mNeFBJDTHv-cHcrw,5,Convenient location as well.
670,VaMEE4mNeFBJDTHv-cHcrw,5,I will surely return to this store!
671,RLASoakAoQ-M7JmwDCPq0A,4,I live in the area so we went here for an early dinner with my mom.
671,RLASoakAoQ-M7JmwDCPq0A,4, This restaurant is connected to the Courtyard Marriott where I've stayed on several occasions.
671,RLASoakAoQ-M7JmwDCPq0A,4,I ordered the Hickory Bourbon Salmon Grilled Zucchini and Mashed Potatoes.
671,RLASoakAoQ-M7JmwDCPq0A,4,My mom ordered a cheese burger and fries.
671,RLASoakAoQ-M7JmwDCPq0A,4,I would've given 5 stars but I wasn't happy with the portion sizes.  I could count how many zucchini's were on my plate and they probably did as well.
671,RLASoakAoQ-M7JmwDCPq0A,4,For the price they should give a little more zucchini and mashed potatoes other than that the food overall was good.
671,RLASoakAoQ-M7JmwDCPq0A,4,Mom enjoyed hers as well.
671,RLASoakAoQ-M7JmwDCPq0A,4,Since COVID is still thriving and numbers are rising.
671,RLASoakAoQ-M7JmwDCPq0A,4, I was leery about dining in the restaurant.
671,RLASoakAoQ-M7JmwDCPq0A,4,But It wasn't crowded and we didn't have to wait long for our food to arrive to our table.
671,RLASoakAoQ-M7JmwDCPq0A,4,Would I recommend?
671,RLASoakAoQ-M7JmwDCPq0A,4,Yes  Would I eat again?
671,RLASoakAoQ-M7JmwDCPq0A,4,I have been eating here for last 22 years I've lived in town.
672,jMakkJgpOzeY9vrVFmVKDg,4,This BurgerPalace sits adjacent to the Marriott Courtyard.
672,jMakkJgpOzeY9vrVFmVKDg,4,"On a cold and billowing 15-degree day, ordering a burger to go seemed like a good choice."
672,jMakkJgpOzeY9vrVFmVKDg,4,"I ordered online, and the cheeseburger and fries were to be ready within 20 minutes."
672,jMakkJgpOzeY9vrVFmVKDg,4,"I arrived 18 minutes after the order, and the order was ready."
672,jMakkJgpOzeY9vrVFmVKDg,4,The burger was cooked to the correct temperature and was good.
672,jMakkJgpOzeY9vrVFmVKDg,4,"The fries were a little limp, which is typical when they accompany a burger in a plastic to go container."
672,jMakkJgpOzeY9vrVFmVKDg,4,That said they were also tasty.
672,jMakkJgpOzeY9vrVFmVKDg,4,"When considering the timeliness of the order, and the convenience of the location, this review ekes out four stars."
672,jMakkJgpOzeY9vrVFmVKDg,4,Would I eat here again?
672,jMakkJgpOzeY9vrVFmVKDg,4,"Yes, if it was convenient, I'd order from here."
672,jMakkJgpOzeY9vrVFmVKDg,4,Would this be a destination of choice?
672,jMakkJgpOzeY9vrVFmVKDg,4,Not likely if there were better alternatives in the area.
673,9Hh3LZgceU4HPY1zGMZ4Mg,2,Service is not great.
673,9Hh3LZgceU4HPY1zGMZ4Mg,2,Food was ok.
673,9Hh3LZgceU4HPY1zGMZ4Mg,2,"Good for a quick meal, if staying at nearby hotel."
674,DFEiMFE1LXntWO_S2Nj7qQ,1,I ordered a medium rare rib eye steak.
674,DFEiMFE1LXntWO_S2Nj7qQ,1, The texture of the steak (which was over seasoned) was as if it was frozen then microwaved and put into the broiler to give it color.
674,DFEiMFE1LXntWO_S2Nj7qQ,1,The broccoli was over salted but at least the mashed potatoes was eatable.
674,DFEiMFE1LXntWO_S2Nj7qQ,1,The server was very nice but when she asked me how the steak was...it was as if she knew it wasn't very good.
674,DFEiMFE1LXntWO_S2Nj7qQ,1,This is NOT the place to order a steak!
675,x8tPH-FJWo1lji1-zNslvA,1,"Very sticky table, chair, everything I touched was sticky, over heard a host saying kaitlin didn't want to service us because she was busy and that she didn't want to be seated anymore,"
675,x8tPH-FJWo1lji1-zNslvA,1,But when we got here there was only maybe 3-5 different family's so it wasnt busy at all so I don't get the problem.
675,x8tPH-FJWo1lji1-zNslvA,1,"The server behind the bar was very nice, now the food..."
675,x8tPH-FJWo1lji1-zNslvA,1,"I don't know what happened but you could tell the chicken wasn't washed or cooked well, it tasted funny, my broccoli was hard,  the spaghetti was like eating rubber very chewy..."
675,x8tPH-FJWo1lji1-zNslvA,1,my stomach in so much pain after eating  only 3 bites of this chicken and broccoli!!!!!
676,4XJo0UeOoScWqYLDp6R0hA,1,BurgerPalace BurgerPalace on Emrick Blvd has the worst bartender.
676,4XJo0UeOoScWqYLDp6R0hA,1, 
676,4XJo0UeOoScWqYLDp6R0hA,1,"She's arrogant, hate written all over her face and shows it thru her attitude."
676,4XJo0UeOoScWqYLDp6R0hA,1,"She's bad for the the restaurant, unless you're caucasian tipping alot of money,then she's kissing your behind like a puppy  "
676,4XJo0UeOoScWqYLDp6R0hA,1,"The restaurant needs to send her to school to learn how to speak to the customers and relate to clients,if not, their business would go down,and that would be ashame for a good restaurant because of 1 thorn in the midst."
677,pscet6kkJ1xNhajZCV3Ymg,1,When you have to keep hunting down your waitress (Kaille) it is a good sign you should eat elsewhere.
677,pscet6kkJ1xNhajZCV3Ymg,1, The food arrived cold and stale.
677,pscet6kkJ1xNhajZCV3Ymg,1," We ordered the burgers, which were promoted as improved (it is hard to imagine them being worse before)."
677,pscet6kkJ1xNhajZCV3Ymg,1," The buns were dry and tasteless, the beef(?) was a congealed mystery, and the toppings needed to be scrapped off (I wouldn't feed a gerbil the lettuce)."
677,pscet6kkJ1xNhajZCV3Ymg,1, No refill on beverages was offered.
677,pscet6kkJ1xNhajZCV3Ymg,1," No measures were taken for Covid: the waitress was unmasked, there was a salad bar that everyone had open access to, no sanitizer to be found, the dishes/silverware/glasses all could have used a good washing, and there was no spacing of patrons (despite there only being a few)."
677,pscet6kkJ1xNhajZCV3Ymg,1," Despite all this, being the holidays and with Covid, a standard tip was given the waitress; who when she saw it huffed off in a snit for not being given more."
677,pscet6kkJ1xNhajZCV3Ymg,1," A TGI Friday's is just down the road, consider going there or someplace else."
678,Zqroe_hKmfu2gg_wv7Aw-w,2,I picked up takeout from this location.
678,Zqroe_hKmfu2gg_wv7Aw-w,2,"I guess the kitchen accidentally made my order for dine-in instead of takeout so when I arrived, it was plated."
678,Zqroe_hKmfu2gg_wv7Aw-w,2,A staff member proceeded to transfer all of my food from the plates to takeout containers.
678,Zqroe_hKmfu2gg_wv7Aw-w,2,He was not wearing gloves or a hair net.
678,Zqroe_hKmfu2gg_wv7Aw-w,2,"Although his hands could've been clean, this is highly unsanitary."
678,Zqroe_hKmfu2gg_wv7Aw-w,2,"After finishing with my food, I definitely saw him scratch his head and not wash his hands so I'm doubtful that there were any hygiene practices in place."
678,Zqroe_hKmfu2gg_wv7Aw-w,2,"From previous trips, I have not been super impressed with BurgerPalace"
678,Zqroe_hKmfu2gg_wv7Aw-w,2,"Their mozzarella sticks were notably crispy, but otherwise average, though they did come in a generous portion."
678,Zqroe_hKmfu2gg_wv7Aw-w,2,Their spinach artichoke dip was not very flavorful.
678,Zqroe_hKmfu2gg_wv7Aw-w,2,"Their soft pretzels sticks were tasty, but the cheese sauce that came with it was congealed and hard to dip into."
678,Zqroe_hKmfu2gg_wv7Aw-w,2,"Also nothing special about their breadsticks, though the butter sauce on the side was a nice touch."
678,Zqroe_hKmfu2gg_wv7Aw-w,2," If you're looking for food of this type, I'd stick with TGI Fridays and Applebee's for better quality."
679,nikUUdgxj4wKAIZZICcFMw,3,Burgers and fries were good.
679,nikUUdgxj4wKAIZZICcFMw,3, The salad bar was a bit messy and not the selection it used to be (plus it's more expensive when swapped out as a side).Service
679,nikUUdgxj4wKAIZZICcFMw,3,was just ok.
679,nikUUdgxj4wKAIZZICcFMw,3, The impressive part was the manager was doing everything he could to get things moving from delivering food to stocking salad bar.
680,etL3kbzsqTbFWyGNY8A9Yw,2,Tables were dirty and even the salt shaker had.
680,etL3kbzsqTbFWyGNY8A9Yw,2,Sticky film on it.
680,etL3kbzsqTbFWyGNY8A9Yw,2,Food was mediocre and won't go again.
681,tYBXCs6ShhWIqCl7lEDAvw,2,This place went downhill  
681,tYBXCs6ShhWIqCl7lEDAvw,2,I went in excited and ordered some spinach and artichoke dip for an appetizer and placed an order for a pulled pork sandwiches well.
681,tYBXCs6ShhWIqCl7lEDAvw,2,We got the appetizer and ate all of it and then the server came out like 25 minutes later to deliver my boyfriends food and tell me that there was no pulled pork.
681,tYBXCs6ShhWIqCl7lEDAvw,2,I just made a salad at the salad bar at that point but why would you wait till his food comes out to tell me?
681,tYBXCs6ShhWIqCl7lEDAvw,2,I thought that was insane.
681,tYBXCs6ShhWIqCl7lEDAvw,2,And it looked very dirty in there anyways.
682,ibHxMZrrDurQlkxcPN8qCw,1,Went here tonight and left before a server even came up to me and my granddaughter!
682,ibHxMZrrDurQlkxcPN8qCw,1,!
682,ibHxMZrrDurQlkxcPN8qCw,1,!
682,ibHxMZrrDurQlkxcPN8qCw,1,Salad bar was not taken care of and waited 30 minutes and no server ever even greeted me or got us water!!!
682,ibHxMZrrDurQlkxcPN8qCw,1,Nothing!!
682,ibHxMZrrDurQlkxcPN8qCw,1,Waste of time!!
683,WqMsv5rOyGoGMDJYLdOo1g,1,Food is good as usual but the stale musty smell coming from the salad bar (works underneath??) makes eating here difficult.
683,WqMsv5rOyGoGMDJYLdOo1g,1,Management needs to get that fixed!!
683,WqMsv5rOyGoGMDJYLdOo1g,1," Tables, walls and booths stained as well as chairs."
683,WqMsv5rOyGoGMDJYLdOo1g,1,Cutlery covered with dishwasher spots.
683,WqMsv5rOyGoGMDJYLdOo1g,1,Holes in carpet under tables.
683,WqMsv5rOyGoGMDJYLdOo1g,1,This place is in serious need of updates!
683,WqMsv5rOyGoGMDJYLdOo1g,1, Won't return until it's done.
684,ueS6mWsgLJnFZ20_AX4u_Q,5,Still love it the cheesesteak deal was great.
684,ueS6mWsgLJnFZ20_AX4u_Q,5,I'm a soco member now such great deals.
685,sGaujSJr7xSC5OygHg_ygA,5,We were seated right away.
685,sGaujSJr7xSC5OygHg_ygA,5, BBQ ribs and salmon entrees were great.
685,sGaujSJr7xSC5OygHg_ygA,5, Kelly is a fantastic waitress.
685,sGaujSJr7xSC5OygHg_ygA,5, Very attentive.   Love this restaurant.
686,dOc4eluSUEkVyQTDqjIcNQ,1,"Gag,,,   Thought would give BurgerPalace another try...."
686,dOc4eluSUEkVyQTDqjIcNQ,1, Had a club soda  at the bar and left.
686,dOc4eluSUEkVyQTDqjIcNQ,1,   It appear the bar area and floors have not been cleaned in years....
686,dOc4eluSUEkVyQTDqjIcNQ,1,  it smells and my feet stuck to the floor... gag gag...
687,BzhAiszkcQHJU195hOq5NA,5,We decided to stop in here after shopping.
687,BzhAiszkcQHJU195hOq5NA,5,It was delicious!
687,BzhAiszkcQHJU195hOq5NA,5,Our steaks were cooked to perfect temp and tender!
687,BzhAiszkcQHJU195hOq5NA,5,Highly recommend!
688,5Kr_J6wCv6EP84Q_8iIrKg,3,I specifically came here an early dinner because I found an unused gift card purchased years ago.
688,5Kr_J6wCv6EP84Q_8iIrKg,3, I appreciate that the gift card did not expire and it was accepted without issue.
688,5Kr_J6wCv6EP84Q_8iIrKg,3, We ordered the ribs and the pulled pork.
688,5Kr_J6wCv6EP84Q_8iIrKg,3, The pork was a bit messed and the taste was mediocre.
688,5Kr_J6wCv6EP84Q_8iIrKg,3, The sauce on the ribs was decent and the meat was tender.
688,5Kr_J6wCv6EP84Q_8iIrKg,3, The service was attentive until it was time to pay.
688,5Kr_J6wCv6EP84Q_8iIrKg,3, Somehow we could not get our server's attention when we wanted the check.
688,5Kr_J6wCv6EP84Q_8iIrKg,3," When we finally flagged her down, she quickly processed our check and the gift card was swiped with no issue."
688,5Kr_J6wCv6EP84Q_8iIrKg,3, I would not eat food from the buffet as I noticed adults and kids touching the buffet serving utensils without them being sanitized.
688,5Kr_J6wCv6EP84Q_8iIrKg,3, The decor seemed a bit outdated and some of the wall wood paneling was worn on the edges.
689,nPG_18ZH4NJExljCYAUyOg,4,"While the food was good and hot, RT was a bit stingy with the soup portion and coleslaw portion sizes."
689,nPG_18ZH4NJExljCYAUyOg,4, All else ok.
689,nPG_18ZH4NJExljCYAUyOg,4,Would order from RT again
690,afjXSNFsYTdwfQzd9paiKg,2,I placed an order online.
690,afjXSNFsYTdwfQzd9paiKg,2,Pulled up to this sign and called.
690,afjXSNFsYTdwfQzd9paiKg,2,They don't answer the phone.
690,afjXSNFsYTdwfQzd9paiKg,2,"So, instead of a curb side pick up, i have to go in."
690,afjXSNFsYTdwfQzd9paiKg,2,That's what i was trying to avoid.
690,afjXSNFsYTdwfQzd9paiKg,2,No hostess on duty.
690,afjXSNFsYTdwfQzd9paiKg,2,A very nervous young man is made to deliver bad news to the customer ahead of me.
690,afjXSNFsYTdwfQzd9paiKg,2,They left exasperated.
690,afjXSNFsYTdwfQzd9paiKg,2,"The manager doesn't answer the phone, schedule a hostess or deliver his own bad news."
690,afjXSNFsYTdwfQzd9paiKg,2,The food was good but i want my tip back.
691,zEmJx7LvNpNwd8MK5KHoZw,2,This review is somewhere between 2 and 3 stars.
691,zEmJx7LvNpNwd8MK5KHoZw,2,The restaurant was very outdated and smelled of wet carpet.
691,zEmJx7LvNpNwd8MK5KHoZw,2,"The staff was friendly enough and efficient, my food came in a reasonable amount of time."
691,zEmJx7LvNpNwd8MK5KHoZw,2,My burger wasn't seasoned and the cook must have smashed all the juice out of the burger because it was dry and overcooked.
691,zEmJx7LvNpNwd8MK5KHoZw,2,"I am not usually that fussy about my burger, somewhere between raw and burnt is usually good enough."
691,zEmJx7LvNpNwd8MK5KHoZw,2,If the cook had got the burger right they would have got the extra star.
691,zEmJx7LvNpNwd8MK5KHoZw,2,Just mediocre at best.
692,XQANBv-j7AH_G4EUcmuJTw,3,"BurgerPalace is my place to eat after dialysis, the service is good and food excellent."
692,XQANBv-j7AH_G4EUcmuJTw,3,We went today and was in the mood for a good hamburger.
692,XQANBv-j7AH_G4EUcmuJTw,3,Since I don't cook anymore i decided to order 2/$22 for my lunch and dinner.
692,XQANBv-j7AH_G4EUcmuJTw,3,My servicer was Megan K and I told her I wanted rare cheeseburger for lunch and bring my pasta home.
692,XQANBv-j7AH_G4EUcmuJTw,3,She comes out with my pasta and put it in front of me.
692,XQANBv-j7AH_G4EUcmuJTw,3,I told no I want my pasta to go home and have my hamburger now.
692,XQANBv-j7AH_G4EUcmuJTw,3,We also order mozzarella stick which still didn't come out yet.
692,XQANBv-j7AH_G4EUcmuJTw,3,The girl at the checkin was running around cleaning all the tables.
692,XQANBv-j7AH_G4EUcmuJTw,3,"I know restaurant are suffering, so make it right."
692,XQANBv-j7AH_G4EUcmuJTw,3,"After my hamburger the waitress told those customers there was no cook, so that explains the delay and bad service."
692,XQANBv-j7AH_G4EUcmuJTw,3,I will go again and hope service gets better.
693,hppcsvOv9-okrGt1ZXD3bQ,2,We arrived in town this afternoon and decided ro try your Restaurant.
693,hppcsvOv9-okrGt1ZXD3bQ,2,I ordered the blackened shrimp and sausage.
693,hppcsvOv9-okrGt1ZXD3bQ,2, It was delicious  but very skimpy on the shrimp and sausage.
693,hppcsvOv9-okrGt1ZXD3bQ,2, My wife ordered the grilled chicken Cobb salad and asked for NO EGGS.
693,hppcsvOv9-okrGt1ZXD3bQ,2,We waited 15-20 minutes for our food to arrive.
693,hppcsvOv9-okrGt1ZXD3bQ,2,The salad had EGGS ON IT.
693,hppcsvOv9-okrGt1ZXD3bQ,2, And there was no dressing.
693,hppcsvOv9-okrGt1ZXD3bQ,2, She took it back and we waited over 20 minutes before she brought her salad with no eggs.
693,hppcsvOv9-okrGt1ZXD3bQ,2,By this time I had already eaten my entree.
693,hppcsvOv9-okrGt1ZXD3bQ,2,We came very close to canceling her order and leaving.
693,hppcsvOv9-okrGt1ZXD3bQ,2,The restaurant was not very busy.
693,hppcsvOv9-okrGt1ZXD3bQ,2,Our waitress was evidently new.
693,hppcsvOv9-okrGt1ZXD3bQ,2,She never asked what type of dressing up front.
693,hppcsvOv9-okrGt1ZXD3bQ,2,We had to point out our entrees on the menu for her when we ordered.
694,8xZj9loBF0GNZNita5CE0A,1,My baked potato had been sitting under a heat light for most of the day.
694,8xZj9loBF0GNZNita5CE0A,1, Was so over cooked it was terrible.
694,8xZj9loBF0GNZNita5CE0A,1, Husbands steak was nowhere near the size he ordered.
694,8xZj9loBF0GNZNita5CE0A,1,  His baked potato was like mine and was half the size of mine.
695,soXseS5rConQyAg3UI2TRg,1,Ewwwww grosss y'all are nasty.
695,soXseS5rConQyAg3UI2TRg,1,Who's the cook?
695,soXseS5rConQyAg3UI2TRg,1,A literal child?
695,soXseS5rConQyAg3UI2TRg,1,How do you mess up chicken tenders?
696,YyBY1khkvdMgb5Cbg4MwrA,2,We have lived in Vero for 4 years now.
696,YyBY1khkvdMgb5Cbg4MwrA,2,We have frequented this restaurant usually twice a month.
696,YyBY1khkvdMgb5Cbg4MwrA,2,Today 1/10/21 we ordered on line for pick up at 6:00.
696,YyBY1khkvdMgb5Cbg4MwrA,2,Getting there on time I found the bar where you pick up orders totally crowded.
696,YyBY1khkvdMgb5Cbg4MwrA,2,There were at least 7 take out bags behind the bar.
696,YyBY1khkvdMgb5Cbg4MwrA,2,The bartender was overwhelmed by the crowd but was very disorganized.
696,YyBY1khkvdMgb5Cbg4MwrA,2," No one was ordering drinks, just all waiting for orders."
696,YyBY1khkvdMgb5Cbg4MwrA,2,At 6:30 someone finally came out to help.
696,YyBY1khkvdMgb5Cbg4MwrA,2,She checked for my order but it was not ready yet.
696,YyBY1khkvdMgb5Cbg4MwrA,2,She went back in the kitchen and did not come back.
696,YyBY1khkvdMgb5Cbg4MwrA,2,I ripped up my ticket and left it on the bar.
696,YyBY1khkvdMgb5Cbg4MwrA,2,If they are that short handed they should not be sending out coupons.
696,YyBY1khkvdMgb5Cbg4MwrA,2,We will not be back.
697,u4bcnBDF0wTraNW_sfBaLw,5,My classmate and I were super satisfied with our 2 for $22 dinner!
697,u4bcnBDF0wTraNW_sfBaLw,5,We are staying here from out of town and after a long day at the hospital the BurgerPalace looked promising (being just about in the same parking lot as well).
697,u4bcnBDF0wTraNW_sfBaLw,5,"We ordered the baked pretzels, the cheese sauce was yummy!"
697,u4bcnBDF0wTraNW_sfBaLw,5,"Got a delicious American burger, cooked perfectly, grilled zucchini, and a sirloin steak with some crispy sweet potato fries and a loaded baker!"
697,u4bcnBDF0wTraNW_sfBaLw,5,"We were happy to sit and enjoy our drinks, a Strawberry Rose Sangria an Island Mai Tai."
697,u4bcnBDF0wTraNW_sfBaLw,5,"The server, Brooke, took great care of us and was very knowledgeable and kind."
697,u4bcnBDF0wTraNW_sfBaLw,5,We appreciate the great service and food after a long day.
697,u4bcnBDF0wTraNW_sfBaLw,5,And in two weeks we'll be back :) c ya again!
698,uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,Tonight was very disappointing.
698,uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,The restaurant was busy.
698,uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,"Our waitress, Nancy was excellent."
698,uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,But the food was not even near par.
698,uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,"The steaks we ordered were very thin cut, a little more cooked than we usually get, but I'm sure that's because they were cut so thin."
698,uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,"The French fries were cold and stale tasting, we did get a second batch which was better."
698,uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,"The restaurant was out of baked potatoes at 6:00 which shouldn't happen, they don't go bad that quickly that you can't keep extra on hand."
698,uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,"There was just no leadership in the kitchen, a lot of people complaining about the wait time for the food and then the food."
698,uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,"So sorry to see this happen, we are regulars and we don't want to see this BurgerPalace close but if this keeps happening people will no longer come here."
698,uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,Please try harder to regain control.
698,uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,Better cooks needed.
698,uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,"Our last visit was just as bad, food wise."
698,uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,Not that it affected us but the bartender shouldn't be the one fixing Togo orders when there are people at the bar and in the dining area waiting for drinks.
698,uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,If it wasn't for Nancy we might not come back.
698,uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,Nancy is our only reason for returning.
698,uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3, Very disappointed.
699,63aKaEZuSdJFWYDgY-4zuw,1,"Well let start by saying everything was cold, then I called because they forgot our appetizer."
699,63aKaEZuSdJFWYDgY-4zuw,1,Pretty much was told that if I wanted my correct food I could come pick it up.
699,63aKaEZuSdJFWYDgY-4zuw,1,"Btw we used door dash, and we all know it's not doordash  fault because of the BurgerPalace staff hands them the food closed-up due to the covid."
699,63aKaEZuSdJFWYDgY-4zuw,1,I've been in this restaurant business for over 20 years and never as a manager what a guest ever hear me say to the host or whom ever answer the phone tell her if they want it don't have to come and get it well guess what BurgerPalace we never want it again since it was in complete an incorrect thank you so much for making our vacation horrible
700,g41dsWWca1FdPWSX2I4e6Q,5,Salad bar . Amazingly wonderful.
700,g41dsWWca1FdPWSX2I4e6Q,5,I love their promotions right now.
700,g41dsWWca1FdPWSX2I4e6Q,5, 
700,g41dsWWca1FdPWSX2I4e6Q,5,Kept clean and fresh
701,ZwKgo60A5rXtvs8wq7yPtA,2,"The food was OK, the service was absolutely terrible."
701,ZwKgo60A5rXtvs8wq7yPtA,2,"Restaurant was FAR from full or even more than 6 customers so to not have a server check on how anything was going showed the didn't care, especially when the employees are yelling and cursing across the restaurant having personal conversations walking past tables."
701,ZwKgo60A5rXtvs8wq7yPtA,2,I waited more than enough time to even receive silverware to eat my pasta.
701,ZwKgo60A5rXtvs8wq7yPtA,2,& the sausage was DISGUSTING completely Oily I removed every piece of sausage out.
701,ZwKgo60A5rXtvs8wq7yPtA,2,The waitress also had our food sitting because when it came out it had the film layer on the food when it starts getting cold from sitting out
702,uO9zg800nLYlWGBuhb_xzQ,5,We had the best time at BurgerPalace in Clinton.
702,uO9zg800nLYlWGBuhb_xzQ,5,"The food was good and I looooved the bottomless salad bar, but it was the INCREDIBLE service by a jack of all trades named K.C. that made our visit exceptional."
702,uO9zg800nLYlWGBuhb_xzQ,5,He greeted us right away with sincerity and a professional joy rarely seen in hosts these days.
702,uO9zg800nLYlWGBuhb_xzQ,5,He made sure to take care of every need and somehow returned to our table multiple times to check on us despite handling so many other things in the restaurant.
702,uO9zg800nLYlWGBuhb_xzQ,5,"Not only was K.C. a serious multi-tasker, he was a genuine people person and clearly invested in creating a wonderful experience for every guest."
702,uO9zg800nLYlWGBuhb_xzQ,5,It is rare to see this level of customer service nowadays.
702,uO9zg800nLYlWGBuhb_xzQ,5,"K.C., we would return just for you!"
702,uO9zg800nLYlWGBuhb_xzQ,5,(Give this man a raise!)
703,4NeKDvm8t_frmMmPrffqGQ,5,This BurgerPalace has always been great.

703,4NeKDvm8t_frmMmPrffqGQ,5,They took good care of us during the pandemic and they continue to do so to this day.
703,4NeKDvm8t_frmMmPrffqGQ,5," Their customers service never fails to impress, also."
703,4NeKDvm8t_frmMmPrffqGQ,5,We also enjoy bringing our family and friends.
703,4NeKDvm8t_frmMmPrffqGQ,5,We love this place.
704,i5eWv7z0XlUmIbb9pCWkPg,5,The waitress Rashell was very hospitable.
704,i5eWv7z0XlUmIbb9pCWkPg,5," Great serrvice, for me, makes a difference in the overall impression of a restaurant."
704,i5eWv7z0XlUmIbb9pCWkPg,5, The salad bar was great.
704,i5eWv7z0XlUmIbb9pCWkPg,5, It had been at least 10 years since I had been in.
704,i5eWv7z0XlUmIbb9pCWkPg,5,BurgerPalace
704,i5eWv7z0XlUmIbb9pCWkPg,5, I will be back sooner than 10 years!
705,eDcVIucBbu2KQO6JqSbOVA,5,Food was excellent the server was really nice and gave outstanding customer service.. will visit again!!
706,oju7IixB7K23wvcMSygG6w,5,I got the ribs mash and broccoli everything was on point and ribs was very tender classic bbq sauce so good on the ribs I'll definitely be back.
706,oju7IixB7K23wvcMSygG6w,5,Me and my friend got mango and strawberry lemonades.
706,oju7IixB7K23wvcMSygG6w,5,Lemonades had real fruit purée really good thank you for a great take out experience.
707,slTBYzhUlwkwN62yU0gDWw,1,We were seated almost 20 min ago.
707,slTBYzhUlwkwN62yU0gDWw,1,1st of all the host sat us a dirty table which I had to ask her to wipe off!
707,slTBYzhUlwkwN62yU0gDWw,1,Then we waited 10 min for a waited and the side we were on there was only one other table with guest!
707,slTBYzhUlwkwN62yU0gDWw,1,The side we were on was FILTHY..as you could see there were 3 tables that have NOT been cleaned!
707,slTBYzhUlwkwN62yU0gDWw,1,As I'm posting this the tables still have NOT been cleaned!
707,slTBYzhUlwkwN62yU0gDWw,1,Our waiter has not been by to remove our salad plates yet.
707,slTBYzhUlwkwN62yU0gDWw,1,Where is management plainly they don't care as to what is going on in here!
707,slTBYzhUlwkwN62yU0gDWw,1,Oh they are sitting down by the bar not doing anything!
707,slTBYzhUlwkwN62yU0gDWw,1,Not checking on the appearance of restaurant or what their employees are doing!!!
707,slTBYzhUlwkwN62yU0gDWw,1,Can we get better management and servers in this place..people spend to much money for this!
707,slTBYzhUlwkwN62yU0gDWw,1,Not to mention the bathroom is just NASTY

710,6ECeJzXgKQwMOxR4ha8Smw,4,Love ordering food for my family for delivery here.
710,6ECeJzXgKQwMOxR4ha8Smw,4,Haven't had many issues other then food being cold or prepared wrong.
710,6ECeJzXgKQwMOxR4ha8Smw,4,Usually they're pretty good with fixing those things thought.
711,ZMO89FItV7a2JB7oU032Ug,1,We had hope for this outing.
711,ZMO89FItV7a2JB7oU032Ug,1,Our first sign to leave was the seeing a cook smoking near the front of the restaurant.
711,ZMO89FItV7a2JB7oU032Ug,1,Our server begged us to pay in cash and promised a free appetizer...
711,ZMO89FItV7a2JB7oU032Ug,1,Repeatedly harped on it.
711,ZMO89FItV7a2JB7oU032Ug,1,I used to be such a fan of the salad bar.
711,ZMO89FItV7a2JB7oU032Ug,1,I ordered the salad bar with soup.
711,ZMO89FItV7a2JB7oU032Ug,1,"The salad bar was full of wilted, mushy vegetables that had gone bad, along with over saturated macaroni and potato salads."
711,ZMO89FItV7a2JB7oU032Ug,1,"The server forgot my soup, but I should have known that was a sign to not consume it -- it was a premade, bagged soup."
711,ZMO89FItV7a2JB7oU032Ug,1,"He said the cook forgot it but by the time it made it to the table, it had a layer of film over the top."
711,ZMO89FItV7a2JB7oU032Ug,1,I almost ordered a burger but glad I didn't because my mother-in-law's burger made her sick.
711,ZMO89FItV7a2JB7oU032Ug,1,I'm really sorry this restaurant went downhill; it used to be so good.
711,ZMO89FItV7a2JB7oU032Ug,1,Not sure how they will recover.
712,kpnD-rlpk5cVU4ii-BEpOQ,4,Was reading reviews and was a little nervous but went in optimistic with the good ones in mind!
712,kpnD-rlpk5cVU4ii-BEpOQ,4,"glad i did, my mom and i had an amazing time!"
712,kpnD-rlpk5cVU4ii-BEpOQ,4,pretty sure our servers name was alex and she was a sweetheart!
712,kpnD-rlpk5cVU4ii-BEpOQ,4,made sure we had everything we needed and kept the refills coming!
712,kpnD-rlpk5cVU4ii-BEpOQ,4,"food was pretty good too, i got the hickory bourbon chicken with mashed potatoes and upgraded to a premium side and got the mac and cheese."
712,kpnD-rlpk5cVU4ii-BEpOQ,4,"couldn't pass up also getting the garden salad bar, it's always been my mom and I's favorite!"
712,kpnD-rlpk5cVU4ii-BEpOQ,4,my mom got the classic cheeseburger with fries and the salad bar.
712,kpnD-rlpk5cVU4ii-BEpOQ,4,"do have to recommend getting the salad bar when you go, it's just unbeatable."
712,kpnD-rlpk5cVU4ii-BEpOQ,4,only reason i'm giving a four star instead of a 5 was because the mac and cheese was a little bland and a tad cold in certain places when it got to us for some reason.
712,kpnD-rlpk5cVU4ii-BEpOQ,4,also had the birthday cake to go and honestly if you enjoy cake it's to die for!
712,kpnD-rlpk5cVU4ii-BEpOQ,4,all in all had a pretty good experience and can see myself driving back up to have another experience there!
713,-bDDwRvr-DqB83gfFVr8LQ,1,Placed order on line for curbside service.
713,-bDDwRvr-DqB83gfFVr8LQ,1,"I had to go in, finally got my food about 10 minutes after scheduled time."
713,-bDDwRvr-DqB83gfFVr8LQ,1,When I got home I found it missing part of order.
713,-bDDwRvr-DqB83gfFVr8LQ,1,"When I called the manager, she wanted me to drive back the 7 miles to pick up missing food."
713,-bDDwRvr-DqB83gfFVr8LQ,1,This place has terrible customer service.
714,bzzSHaEjcg-DOCBto11NAQ,5,My husband and I chose to go out to eat tonight.
714,bzzSHaEjcg-DOCBto11NAQ,5,Our waitress was Amanda.
714,bzzSHaEjcg-DOCBto11NAQ,5,This young lady was so pleasant and very professional.
714,bzzSHaEjcg-DOCBto11NAQ,5,There's such a grace about her in how she takes care of each individual table and person.
714,bzzSHaEjcg-DOCBto11NAQ,5,Amanda's attentiveness was Awesome!!!
714,bzzSHaEjcg-DOCBto11NAQ,5,"This girl deserves a raise, promotion or something!"
714,bzzSHaEjcg-DOCBto11NAQ,5,Been a while since we've had customer service like that.
714,bzzSHaEjcg-DOCBto11NAQ,5,The person who restocked the salad bar was also pleasant.
714,bzzSHaEjcg-DOCBto11NAQ,5,Worth a revisit...
715,5c4NRlU2n9Ox2YMVLzAM2Q,1,Service here is terrible.
715,5c4NRlU2n9Ox2YMVLzAM2Q,1,Got seated at a booth in the bar and sat for 10 minutes before a server approached us.
715,5c4NRlU2n9Ox2YMVLzAM2Q,1,Our drink order took another 10 minutes to be delivered to the table.
715,5c4NRlU2n9Ox2YMVLzAM2Q,1,Our food order was not correctly cooked to the desired temps.
715,5c4NRlU2n9Ox2YMVLzAM2Q,1,Overall bad experience
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,My expectations weren't very high considering all these reviews.
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,"However, if I had to starve or eat at this establishment again, I'd starve."
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,"There are many factors that made me decide to steer nearly every single person considering going to this establishment far, far away."
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,Cleanliness:
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,I don't think there are enough staff members to keep this place clean.
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,It's apparent that they're overwhelmed by the patrons that decided to visit this establishment.
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,"It needs a thorough power washing and bleaching, as well as an overhaul on the tables and seats."
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,1/5 stars.
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,"The reason they get 1 star, my table wasn't wobbly."
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,Service:
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,"Unfortunately, I don't think our server was ever properly trained."
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,"We continuously had other peoples food coming to our table, we had our food going to other tables--our drinks took well over 20 minutes to arrive, and they weren't anything extravagant."
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,Orders weren't correct and the wait was excruciatingly long.
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,"If we didn't opt to get the salad bar, we would have sat waiting for our food for 48 minutes."
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,"Again, nothing too difficult was ordered."
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,0/5 stars...
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,I could have done a better job with no training and provided our table with better service than we received.
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,Food:
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,I'm not quite sure how I managed to eat half of my burger or how my friend managed to eat what we called mysterymeattacodillas.
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,"The other item ordered was the Triple Play, and the shrimp that came with it tasted as if it was bought from the grocery store frozen section, ribs were dry and didn't even look edible."
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,"The salad bar held us over, but it was not refreshed, bowls were bare from the time we arrived until the time we left."
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,Half of our items were under heat lamps for at least 5 minutes.
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,"Again, not expecting much, but this really was a terrible experience."
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,"1/5 stars, because our French fries were fresh."
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,It's pretty hard to mess French fries up though...
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,It took over 20 minutes to be able to pay our bill.
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,Our server didn't have any idea how to reconcile our checks and repeatedly told us a manager was coming to assist.
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,"No manager ever showed up, and we pretty much had to figure out their ""cash register"" device ourselves and just sort it out."
716,bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,Save yourself from the aggravation and find a locally owned restaurant to go.
717,n6J9TEkthn9OqYU5JyO6Zg,1,Service is horrendous!
717,n6J9TEkthn9OqYU5JyO6Zg,1, The bartender who works on Friday nights is rude.
717,n6J9TEkthn9OqYU5JyO6Zg,1, 
717,n6J9TEkthn9OqYU5JyO6Zg,1,Making the atmosphere miserable.
717,n6J9TEkthn9OqYU5JyO6Zg,1, Food was cold when served.
717,n6J9TEkthn9OqYU5JyO6Zg,1,It's a shame this is the only restaurant close to the airport.
717,n6J9TEkthn9OqYU5JyO6Zg,1,A lot of these customers are just passing through.
717,n6J9TEkthn9OqYU5JyO6Zg,1,Thank you BurgerPalace for a great welcome!
717,n6J9TEkthn9OqYU5JyO6Zg,1,Not recommending this place.
717,n6J9TEkthn9OqYU5JyO6Zg,1,Higher new management
718,YIMmaTmZBVcUX8r0x3RxDw,5,"Had great service, great food, and great times with family tonight at this restaurant!"
718,YIMmaTmZBVcUX8r0x3RxDw,5,They were busy but very attentive and the food was good.
718,YIMmaTmZBVcUX8r0x3RxDw,5,Price was amazing also!
718,YIMmaTmZBVcUX8r0x3RxDw,5,I would definitely say give it a try even though previous reviews might deter you from visiting.
718,YIMmaTmZBVcUX8r0x3RxDw,5,We really had a great time and Chris our waiter was tremendous!
719,hAVz6u-gXZQ32zwZFcqQ5g,2,Took 20 min just for waiter to ask us for drinks maybe cuz we were dressed weird was not busy.
719,hAVz6u-gXZQ32zwZFcqQ5g,2,Took equally amount as long to get the drinks my food was hard never knew brisket is that hard to cheer waitress never came back once to ask us if we needed anything and had the nerve to watch us to see how much tip we were leaving on the screen avoid this place if you can
720,QwIJvf3Jgvk3GOpr515nJw,1,"We asked for a table for 5 - we were 2 Americans, 2 Mexicans and a Mayan from Guatemala."
720,QwIJvf3Jgvk3GOpr515nJw,1,"We waited 20 minutes in a pretty empty restaurant for a server who was disrespectful and said and chicken or steak would ""take a long time"" because we were ""not a priority of the kitchen""."
720,QwIJvf3Jgvk3GOpr515nJw,1,It was 3:10pm and there were few people in a very large restaurant.
720,QwIJvf3Jgvk3GOpr515nJw,1,Why?
720,QwIJvf3Jgvk3GOpr515nJw,1,Racism?
720,QwIJvf3Jgvk3GOpr515nJw,1,We were all speaking g Spanish.
720,QwIJvf3Jgvk3GOpr515nJw,1,We got up and left.
720,QwIJvf3Jgvk3GOpr515nJw,1,We will never go back there.
721,84Axk_ktRs2_l91PcaMlug,5,"Well the reviews here are low, but I found myself at a nearby hotel at 7:30pm on a Tuesday with no car."
721,84Axk_ktRs2_l91PcaMlug,5,I walked over and was pleasantly surprised.
721,84Axk_ktRs2_l91PcaMlug,5,"Clean facility, got seated immediately, server was prompt, food was good."
721,84Axk_ktRs2_l91PcaMlug,5,I went with a sirloin and rice/veggies.
721,84Axk_ktRs2_l91PcaMlug,5,"It was cooked medium as requested, tender, and no excessive fat."
721,84Axk_ktRs2_l91PcaMlug,5,I'm glad I came.
721,84Axk_ktRs2_l91PcaMlug,5,You some come too.
722,lmM8uILbEUPyj5IhBYwuTQ,1,Waiter at the bar was rude.. gave me molded fruit in my drink!
722,lmM8uILbEUPyj5IhBYwuTQ,1,Took forever to even see if the table needed anything.
722,lmM8uILbEUPyj5IhBYwuTQ,1,The salad bar was never refreshed.
722,lmM8uILbEUPyj5IhBYwuTQ,1,The service here went downhill.
723,TMVmZgWPLhNRu4RGr1-G7w,1,Terrible.
723,TMVmZgWPLhNRu4RGr1-G7w,1, Got ribs and I Needed a chainsaw to eat them.
723,TMVmZgWPLhNRu4RGr1-G7w,1, (I would have sent them back had I not gotten the to go) they went right in the trash.
723,TMVmZgWPLhNRu4RGr1-G7w,1, Such a waste of money.
723,TMVmZgWPLhNRu4RGr1-G7w,1," Also, there was an extremely drunk guy sitting next to me at the bar while waiting on my food."
723,TMVmZgWPLhNRu4RGr1-G7w,1," He was clearly over served, could barely keep his eyes open and yet he was continually served."
723,TMVmZgWPLhNRu4RGr1-G7w,1,"   So sad because BurgerPalace used to be one of my favorite places.    Now that I've thrown $25.00 of food in the trash, I'll never be back."
724,zfigRebIgdfyqQGEQtw7Bw,2,"We got the salad bar, and the food tasted fine, but it was $13 just for the salad bar."
724,zfigRebIgdfyqQGEQtw7Bw,2,"The prices were very high, I thought."
724,zfigRebIgdfyqQGEQtw7Bw,2,They wanted $19.49 for a chicken sandwich and around $16 for a hamburger.
724,zfigRebIgdfyqQGEQtw7Bw,2,"The restaurant was not very clean, and the bathroom was disgusting."
724,zfigRebIgdfyqQGEQtw7Bw,2,"My fingers were sticking to the door when I entered, my feet were sticking to the floor when I walked in, and everything was very dirty."
724,zfigRebIgdfyqQGEQtw7Bw,2,It looked like it wasn't cleaned in months.
724,zfigRebIgdfyqQGEQtw7Bw,2,If you can find another option nearby you might want to try that.
725,BsUeOe3iwl2X6xGhQweM0g,2,This restaurant was basically 50 feet away from the Hampton Inn so it was a no-brainer.
725,BsUeOe3iwl2X6xGhQweM0g,2,I was a little concerned because all of the BurgerPalace in my area back towards Pittsburgh were closed so I thought they were all gone.
725,BsUeOe3iwl2X6xGhQweM0g,2,"They're still cling to their stupid Covid policy  and I may have had the most inexperienced waiter ever, the New Orleans seafood was supposed to come with two sides but it didn't and I basically shamed him into bringing rice."
725,BsUeOe3iwl2X6xGhQweM0g,2,"I don't blame him, I blame the manager who did not train him and unleashed him on the public."
725,BsUeOe3iwl2X6xGhQweM0g,2,Soon this BurgerPalace will be added to the list of closed restaurants.
726,M8RmhI2pblxbmzGQzAMPVg,2,Not bad but definitely not the best.
726,M8RmhI2pblxbmzGQzAMPVg,2,Sad to see that the BurgerPalace chain is slowly dying when they used to be really good!
726,M8RmhI2pblxbmzGQzAMPVg,2,Salad bar increased in price while the food quality of it decreased.
726,M8RmhI2pblxbmzGQzAMPVg,2,All of the plates were dirty for it & the lettuce was wilted.
726,M8RmhI2pblxbmzGQzAMPVg,2,We ordered mild buffalo wings also with ranch.
726,M8RmhI2pblxbmzGQzAMPVg,2,"Wings were alright but definitely some frozen brand, they always have a specific taste to them."
726,M8RmhI2pblxbmzGQzAMPVg,2,Ranch wasn't its normal consistency it was watered down.
726,M8RmhI2pblxbmzGQzAMPVg,2,Only reason for the 2 stars was our waiter was nice yet he was sitting at the bar while we were waiting for our check.
726,M8RmhI2pblxbmzGQzAMPVg,2,Such a shame that this chain restaurant is going into the gutter.
727,CohzsrDlYZvaOsnwD3IxQg,3,The salad bar at BurgerPalace is very good.
727,CohzsrDlYZvaOsnwD3IxQg,3,If you have kids it's a good spot for a quick meal.
727,CohzsrDlYZvaOsnwD3IxQg,3,"Probably would go to a more upscale for a date night, but for a fast, decent family dinner it's good."
728,ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1,Horrible!!!
728,ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1," Not necessarily our waitresses fault, but partially."
728,ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1," 3 tables sitting including us another couple walked in, by this time we had our drinks and ordered."
728,ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1, The other two tables had their food already.
728,ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1," Table #4 got their food well before us, still not a horrible issue."
728,ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1," Finally our food starts to come out 2 of my 4 kids got mild wings, one came out Buffalo, child 3 got a burger, I got a quesadilla..."
728,ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1,the other 2 people (1 child and my husband) got no food.
728,ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1, 20 min passes and still no food!
728,ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1," We went to the bar and questioned 2x by now and was told the kitchen is slow, we are the ONLY table in the restaurant with no food!"
728,ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1," We didn't see our waitress in this 20 min span, I went to the waitress station and got napkins and ketchup, I also went and got a rag from another table that still wasn't bussed or wiped when we had a spill and cleaned the mess up."
728,ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1, No management skills at this location at all!
728,ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1, This should not be acceptable at any business much less a restaurant.
728,ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1," When the remaining food did arrive it was inedible, my husband couldn't even bite through his chicken sandwich because it was so over cooked, the youngest child's pasta and sauce was ice cold and the fries tasted as if they were left from the day before."
728,ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1, Items on the salad bar actually had ice on them as if they were frozen.
728,ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1," We could see at least 3-4 people in the kitchen so actually making edible food (burgers, sandwiches, wings and kid pasta) shouldn't be challenging."
728,ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1, And after everything we still got a bill for $100+.  Now everyone is hungry and it's only 30 min later because everyone's food was disgusting.
728,ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1, 
728,ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1,Stay away
729,c7NxzBKwOaNRgjUK_BE4IA,1,I would give a zero if I could on this visitPlaced a doordash order since I was in the middle of a few things...
729,c7NxzBKwOaNRgjUK_BE4IA,1,"Doordash driver got lost and just decided to cancel my orderI placed an order online stopped what I was doing to drive in since at this point 40 minutes later after stating 20 minute delievery was set on getting what I wantedWalked in and stood at bar for ten awaiting the girl to get off her phone crouched down paying no attention to me even walking up, so I finally said excuse me, she rolled her eyes and said I got to go and walked overThe order on the bar was not mine and was told few minutes10 more minutes later (even though order stated would be ready at the time I walked in) finally got my food...over an hour waiting for a simple app and soup..."
729,c7NxzBKwOaNRgjUK_BE4IA,1,"shame on you guys, I've worked at many restaurants that woukdve NEVER allowed any if this, I have never felt so frustrated and unappreciated as a customer"
730,9PsPS1-TJZIi1iiPw7Zp8A,1,So we just left.
730,9PsPS1-TJZIi1iiPw7Zp8A,1,We got seated after going into bar area so bartender could see us.
730,9PsPS1-TJZIi1iiPw7Zp8A,1,"Sat at the table for over 15 minutes and nobody came to ask about drinks, take order nothing."
730,9PsPS1-TJZIi1iiPw7Zp8A,1,"Looked at the salad bar which used to be our favorite, now it's pretty bland and not good."
730,9PsPS1-TJZIi1iiPw7Zp8A,1,This is the ladt time we try BurgerPalace
730,9PsPS1-TJZIi1iiPw7Zp8A,1,"Such a shame we used to like to ho there, well to the Montgomeryville location but it closed."
730,9PsPS1-TJZIi1iiPw7Zp8A,1,What waste of our time.
730,9PsPS1-TJZIi1iiPw7Zp8A,1,There was only 7 tables at the time we were there.
731,kYjEaAs3DPTfb36qYHS1YA,5,I was here on business and decided to grab a bit to eat .
731,kYjEaAs3DPTfb36qYHS1YA,5,Being by myself you always feel A little awkward but when I went in I was greeted properly by server name Neil.
731,kYjEaAs3DPTfb36qYHS1YA,5,He fortunately was my waiter also he greeted me with a smile and did not make me feel uncomfortable at all dinning by myself.
731,kYjEaAs3DPTfb36qYHS1YA,5,I observed him taking care of all the other guest he was very accommodating and courteous very attentive you are very lucky to have him as a server Neil thank you
732,dLLAkDVPTL3DOLw9bZQmiA,1,Don't waste your time.
732,dLLAkDVPTL3DOLw9bZQmiA,1,I understand many establishments are experiencing staffing issue but this location has been pretty bad for years.
732,dLLAkDVPTL3DOLw9bZQmiA,1,They really needs to adapt and adjust.
732,dLLAkDVPTL3DOLw9bZQmiA,1,I stood in the hostess area for 15min and watched multiple servers walk right by me and not say a word.
732,dLLAkDVPTL3DOLw9bZQmiA,1, 
732,dLLAkDVPTL3DOLw9bZQmiA,1,Left and will not be returning.
733,-xcfr2pYGJ7v_Nr6c-eLCg,5,Place was short staffed but they still managed to serve great food in a timely matter.
733,-xcfr2pYGJ7v_Nr6c-eLCg,5,Our server Neil was amazing.
733,-xcfr2pYGJ7v_Nr6c-eLCg,5,He had 5-6 tables he was serving and had a very upbeat and positive attitude.
733,-xcfr2pYGJ7v_Nr6c-eLCg,5,Definitely recommend this place if I'm the area.
734,KQyI2KTLqPkzgs2S-ue1Iw,1,Service is terrible.
734,KQyI2KTLqPkzgs2S-ue1Iw,1,Attitude is unnecessary.
734,KQyI2KTLqPkzgs2S-ue1Iw,1,That was before I found out my soup was wrong and returned to have it corrected!
734,KQyI2KTLqPkzgs2S-ue1Iw,1,1/2 cup of soup for 6.79 is a bit much too.
734,KQyI2KTLqPkzgs2S-ue1Iw,1,Don't plan to visit.
734,KQyI2KTLqPkzgs2S-ue1Iw,1,It's not worth it.
734,KQyI2KTLqPkzgs2S-ue1Iw,1,Vinny should not be the pickup person.
735,cnVNYPH00JH9HVu-Au3cCw,1,I'm only giving A one star because I can't give no stars this meal was awful the manager was rude and I do not recommend eating at this place
736,UnGVBUBbWSVT-92IJgN6aA,4,I miss ours in TN so we decided to stop while visiting GA.
736,UnGVBUBbWSVT-92IJgN6aA,4,Not a bad location.
736,UnGVBUBbWSVT-92IJgN6aA,4,Accessible and good parking.
736,UnGVBUBbWSVT-92IJgN6aA,4,Salad bar is still amazing.
736,UnGVBUBbWSVT-92IJgN6aA,4,I only wish more salad bars had some fruit only because I like a little sweet with the salty.
736,UnGVBUBbWSVT-92IJgN6aA,4,$11.99 for the endless bar is still an AMAZING deal.
736,UnGVBUBbWSVT-92IJgN6aA,4,They provide gloves so you don't have to worry about touching contaminated serving utensils.
736,UnGVBUBbWSVT-92IJgN6aA,4,The salad bar was well stocked and appeared pretty fresh.
736,UnGVBUBbWSVT-92IJgN6aA,4,We were the first customers of the day so no wait for seating.
736,UnGVBUBbWSVT-92IJgN6aA,4,My husband had the grilled salmon with grilled zucchini which was also very flavorful and a good portion.
736,UnGVBUBbWSVT-92IJgN6aA,4,Unfortunately I forgot to take pictures because we were so focused on eating.
736,UnGVBUBbWSVT-92IJgN6aA,4,Server was friendly and attentive.
736,UnGVBUBbWSVT-92IJgN6aA,4,Will definitely go back when we are in the area.
736,UnGVBUBbWSVT-92IJgN6aA,4,It is absolutely a better option than the numerous fast food places.
737,FE2NzeCoSa3USBeC_mD7AQ,3,Loved every ruby tuesday I have ever been to but tonight I was extremely disappointed.
737,FE2NzeCoSa3USBeC_mD7AQ,3,Our family decided to order curbside pick up.
737,FE2NzeCoSa3USBeC_mD7AQ,3,Easy ordering process we were told from the website our order would be ready 20 min after it was placed.
737,FE2NzeCoSa3USBeC_mD7AQ,3,Pull up to the pick up order stall and no one picks up the phone wait another 20 min..
737,FE2NzeCoSa3USBeC_mD7AQ,3,I finally decide to walk in.
737,FE2NzeCoSa3USBeC_mD7AQ,3,"I was passed by several people when I waited, finally someone helped me to be told something I ordered wasn't available, not a big deal ordered something else."
737,FE2NzeCoSa3USBeC_mD7AQ,3,Wasn't to bad of a wait but got home the food was extremely cold and my burger buns were burnt and my burger was raw.
737,FE2NzeCoSa3USBeC_mD7AQ,3, If it wasn't for the fact that I know everyone is short staffed I'd give one star.
737,FE2NzeCoSa3USBeC_mD7AQ,3,You may get better service and food if you dine in.
738,3Fa9EoJhbGG_7wXmR4Xerw,4,We have eaten here twice now and the first time was outstanding the second was OK.
738,3Fa9EoJhbGG_7wXmR4Xerw,4, 
738,3Fa9EoJhbGG_7wXmR4Xerw,4,"I had a fish fish the first time which was exceptionally tasty and I enjoyed it immensely, my wife ordered the chicken crunch and said it was fantastic!  The second time we came I had a burger and the garlic parmesan wings...I didn't care for the wings and the burger was just ok...the salad bar is always great we had it both times everything appears fresh and crisp.  The wait staff has been very friendly both times although it does appear they are under staffed due to the wait we had as the restaurant appeared empty but with the way things are nowadays it is happening everywhere...we will be back to try some new items"
739,lHgqgk1wzBZQVnSxoCY3uQ,5,"Ordered some food to-go for the family tonight, and when I went to pick it up I experienced wonderful service and really hard-working staff, making sure everyone was taken care of!"
739,lHgqgk1wzBZQVnSxoCY3uQ,5,"Our food was delicious, too."
739,lHgqgk1wzBZQVnSxoCY3uQ,5,I can tell the manager (Samantha I think was her name) was really looking out for the staff and customers.
739,lHgqgk1wzBZQVnSxoCY3uQ,5,We will definitely be coming back!
739,lHgqgk1wzBZQVnSxoCY3uQ,5,!
740,lAkqOJKSnIGh_oFoAVf-Uw,1,I ordered a brisket plate with 2 sides.
740,lAkqOJKSnIGh_oFoAVf-Uw,1,"The brisket was old, it was turning a darker color on different places."
740,lAkqOJKSnIGh_oFoAVf-Uw,1,It tasted like it was the one that you would get from Walmart in the meat section for the microwave.
740,lAkqOJKSnIGh_oFoAVf-Uw,1,My sides were corn and backed beans.
740,lAkqOJKSnIGh_oFoAVf-Uw,1,"For 1 they were cold and for 2, they tasted as if they came from a can."
740,lAkqOJKSnIGh_oFoAVf-Uw,1,Tasted bland.
740,lAkqOJKSnIGh_oFoAVf-Uw,1,And the BBQ sauce was from a bottle.
740,lAkqOJKSnIGh_oFoAVf-Uw,1,Worst I have ever had.
740,lAkqOJKSnIGh_oFoAVf-Uw,1,Good thing I don't live here
740,lAkqOJKSnIGh_oFoAVf-Uw,1,.
740,lAkqOJKSnIGh_oFoAVf-Uw,1,"I would NOT recommend this place to anybody, even my worst enemy!!"
741,OI2_F2orsrWTCh14gX2xoA,1,Went to men's restroom hot water scalded my hands.
741,OI2_F2orsrWTCh14gX2xoA,1,Steak was over cooked.
741,OI2_F2orsrWTCh14gX2xoA,1,Table next to walked out after waiting a hour for a chicken paste dish.
741,OI2_F2orsrWTCh14gX2xoA,1,They said it did not look like menu item.
741,OI2_F2orsrWTCh14gX2xoA,1,"My second steak owa medium well, not medium rare."
741,OI2_F2orsrWTCh14gX2xoA,1,One cook had already walked out.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,Worst meal and service I can ever remember.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1, I have never written a review before but just felt I owed it to the paying public this time.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1, There was a sign on the door that the fryer was down so we couldn't order anything fried.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1, At 1:00 on a Saturday afternoon there was only one other table seated when we arrived.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1, Should have been my first clue.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1, We were 2 adults and 2 children.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1, The children ordered plain hamburgers and one also got the salad bar.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1, One adult ordered the salad bar and I ordered broccoli cheese soup.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,"We also had 2 Cokes, 1 iced tea and a water."
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1, We waited well over an hour for the hamburgers and  the soup.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1, The soup was cold and had sat so long it had congealed on the top and shook like jello when I touched it.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1, The waitress was still at the table and I asked her was it normal for the soup to be like that.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1, She couldn't even be bothered to answer.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1, I told her she could take it  back which she did.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1," She didn't offer me an appology, a fresh bowl or a different menu item."
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1, Just left and never came back.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1, We never were asked if the rest of the meal was ok or if we needed drink refills.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1," I wanted to walk out but we waited way, way to long for the check."
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1, I asked here if there was a manager and she said yes and turned around and went back in the kitchen.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1, When the manager arrived I told her how bad everything had been.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1, She said the soup was fine that it had just sat under a heat lamp.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1, That could be true but it must have been there for an hour.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1, Her idea of compensation was for me to give her my address and she would send me a discount for my next visit.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1, I told her I  was traveling and just passing through and I would not be coming back.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1, I asked if there was anything she could do for us today since I didn't even get to eat anything after spending 1-1/2 hours in her fine establishment.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1," She said nope, sorry nothing she could do."
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1, I wouldn't send my worst enemy there.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1, I can be very understanding that things happen but these guys didn't even try to care.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,The other adult in our party used the ladies room and said it was  very dirty and had smeared feces everywhere.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1, That's all I will say about that.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,"They blame so many problems on covid but they were not busy, only saw 3 takeout orders go past us during our 1-1/2 hrs, and the waitresses and hostess were just sitting in the bar area on their phones."
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1, A guy came out of the back with an apron on and a cigarette in his hand.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1, He went outside and smoked right outside our window.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1, I don't know if he was the cook and took a break or what.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1, After we left I pulled up the reviews for this place and blame myself for even trying it.
742,ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,Don't say you haven't been warned.
743,YguV3dKWyPqMGirtvyKYuw,1,You should be ashamed of yourselves 3rd partying for Wow Bao.
743,YguV3dKWyPqMGirtvyKYuw,1,It's disgusting and tasted like bleach.
743,YguV3dKWyPqMGirtvyKYuw,1,Are you guys trying to get my family sick?
743,YguV3dKWyPqMGirtvyKYuw,1,Paid an arm and a leg for nothing.
743,YguV3dKWyPqMGirtvyKYuw,1,I hold the entire establishment responsible.
744,gzjrrSBVOJSg8w-ZwsL_7Q,1,5:05pm
744,gzjrrSBVOJSg8w-ZwsL_7Q,1,Arrived to BurgerPalace Restaurant was not full but waitress was busy.
744,gzjrrSBVOJSg8w-ZwsL_7Q,1,Ordered brisket sandwich and a brisket platter for our group 15 minutes later was informed they were out of brisket.
744,gzjrrSBVOJSg8w-ZwsL_7Q,1,Ordered 2 other meals and by 6:05 left with only paying for our drinks and no meals on the table.
744,gzjrrSBVOJSg8w-ZwsL_7Q,1,Sad this establishment is not better.
745,_y8yX0uJ6sxt-LxZSO0Euw,5,The food was excellent.
745,_y8yX0uJ6sxt-LxZSO0Euw,5,"Delicious salad bar and chicken/corn chowder, and a smokehouse burger done just right."
745,_y8yX0uJ6sxt-LxZSO0Euw,5,"Our server, Mimi, was outstanding -- very efficient and friendly."
745,_y8yX0uJ6sxt-LxZSO0Euw,5,"To top things off, hubby got a free birthday sundae."
745,_y8yX0uJ6sxt-LxZSO0Euw,5,Most enjoyable!
746,hnm9k28r39eyrO_-S1Se5w,2,"BurgerPalace is one of my favorite ""go-to"" restaurants for a quick, decent dinner."
746,hnm9k28r39eyrO_-S1Se5w,2,"Though I have previously reviewed this restaurant favorably, I was not happy with our last experience."
746,hnm9k28r39eyrO_-S1Se5w,2,We ordered dinner on Sunday for pick up.
746,hnm9k28r39eyrO_-S1Se5w,2,"I went with my usual (hickory bourbon salmon, rice, grilled zucchini); my husband had the bourbon chicken with broccoli and mac and cheese; my daughter ordered the chicken carbonara."
746,hnm9k28r39eyrO_-S1Se5w,2,"Though my meal was good and my daughter enjoyed her pasta, someone seemed to have dropped the ball in the presentation of my husband's meal."
746,hnm9k28r39eyrO_-S1Se5w,2,"Usually, the veggies are separated for the to-go meals, especially when there is a sauce involved."
746,hnm9k28r39eyrO_-S1Se5w,2,Who wants their veggies swimming in a sauce intended for the meat???
746,hnm9k28r39eyrO_-S1Se5w,2,Just hurt looking at how this meal was prepared/packed for pick up.
746,hnm9k28r39eyrO_-S1Se5w,2,My daughter picked up the order and didn't bother looking before leaving.
746,hnm9k28r39eyrO_-S1Se5w,2,"If I had picked up the meals and noticed how my husband's meal was packed, I would have returned it."
746,hnm9k28r39eyrO_-S1Se5w,2,"My husband got the bourbon chicken he ordered, but he also got ""bourbon broccoli!"""
746,hnm9k28r39eyrO_-S1Se5w,2,Seems someone just didn't care when packing this meal.
746,hnm9k28r39eyrO_-S1Se5w,2,I know there are plenty of problems in this world and having an abundance of bourbon sauce on one's broccoli may not be a big deal.
746,hnm9k28r39eyrO_-S1Se5w,2,"But, for folks like me who like for the food to not only taste good but look good presentation-wise, I was a bit disappointed in BurgerPalace this time."
746,hnm9k28r39eyrO_-S1Se5w,2,May be a while before I return. :o(
747,DfLAQke3OReKxGmaPC_uyQ,5,"Lunch today, straight up salad bar."
747,DfLAQke3OReKxGmaPC_uyQ,5," OMG, refreshing to find a fully stacked, fresh salad option in town."
747,DfLAQke3OReKxGmaPC_uyQ,5, Staff was fast and attentive.
747,DfLAQke3OReKxGmaPC_uyQ,5," Been around awhile, could use a facility facelift."
747,DfLAQke3OReKxGmaPC_uyQ,5," However, Management making it happen while obviously short staffed."
747,DfLAQke3OReKxGmaPC_uyQ,5,"  Good job, making this one the weekly lunch stops!"
748,hXEgV_4ka1RWuYs6iEgYSg,3,"Stopped in on a recent, rainy Saturday with my BOGO coupon."
748,hXEgV_4ka1RWuYs6iEgYSg,3," I like to do this as it gives me an easy second meal I can take home, refrigerate and enjoy a day or two later."
748,hXEgV_4ka1RWuYs6iEgYSg,3, I have done this twice in recent weeks.
748,hXEgV_4ka1RWuYs6iEgYSg,3, I also go to Ruby's to enjoy watching sports on their bar-area TV's.
748,hXEgV_4ka1RWuYs6iEgYSg,3," On the most recent visit, that was a BIG mistake as their reception apparently is quite poor during periods of inclement weather."
748,hXEgV_4ka1RWuYs6iEgYSg,3," The smokehouse burger and fries were great, the salad bar was terrific and well-stocked and very fresh; staff were wearing masks; the manager was present out front throughout my visit (which u don't see everywhere); everything pretty solid, but one problem: no life in the bar, no light-hearted chat among 3 bartenders!"
748,hXEgV_4ka1RWuYs6iEgYSg,3," They made 0 effort to talk with me, to make me feel welcome, to make me feel part of the gang."
748,hXEgV_4ka1RWuYs6iEgYSg,3, Very poor approach; only words to me were to take my order and take my payment.
748,hXEgV_4ka1RWuYs6iEgYSg,3, 
748,hXEgV_4ka1RWuYs6iEgYSg,3,"Got to learn some people skills, ladies, and I was the ONLY guest at the bar and only 1 of about 5 guests in the entire bar area."
748,hXEgV_4ka1RWuYs6iEgYSg,3, Very sad.
749,SKD8RINR3AKfVAorGj0TJA,5,All i had was the garden bar and it was great.
749,SKD8RINR3AKfVAorGj0TJA,5,"Lots of variety and options, and my server was great as well."
750,wCOgIUFFAYeUf-NY5S6RHg,3,Pleasantly surprised.
750,wCOgIUFFAYeUf-NY5S6RHg,3,When I called to ask about the particulars of the restaurant whether it's open for available dining inside or takeout and what time they close she had major attitude on the phone which almost made me not want to eat there I can understand it gets frustrating being called and asked the same thing over and over are you available to eat inside but what do you expect people are going to ask that until things go back to normal
751,jR-Y3JhysTNYmqk8phM0WQ,4,"My normal favorite at BurgerPalace is the salad bar and French onion soup, so that's my go to meal for lunch."
751,jR-Y3JhysTNYmqk8phM0WQ,4,The virus has changed all of that of course.
751,jR-Y3JhysTNYmqk8phM0WQ,4,"So, I was trying to get a friend and her family to meet me for lunch, but she was not comfortable with that."
751,jR-Y3JhysTNYmqk8phM0WQ,4,"So I offered my house with curb side pick up, and that was a go."
751,jR-Y3JhysTNYmqk8phM0WQ,4,"So I online ordered two rib meals, and a honey bourbon chicken meal, with 3 fries and three side salads."
751,jR-Y3JhysTNYmqk8phM0WQ,4,I was all ready for pick up on time as promised.
751,jR-Y3JhysTNYmqk8phM0WQ,4,"Came home, mixed all the salads together into one bowl, threw the awesome fries into the oven for a few minutes to make sure they weren't soggy from riding in a styrofoam box, and we had ourselves an awesome buffet in no time."
751,jR-Y3JhysTNYmqk8phM0WQ,4,So it worked out great.
751,jR-Y3JhysTNYmqk8phM0WQ,4,Ribs and chicken were awesome.
751,jR-Y3JhysTNYmqk8phM0WQ,4,"French fries were very good, and I normally don't even eat French fries."
751,jR-Y3JhysTNYmqk8phM0WQ,4,Served 4 people easily and everyone took leftovers home for another meal.
751,jR-Y3JhysTNYmqk8phM0WQ,4,I got this!
751,jR-Y3JhysTNYmqk8phM0WQ,4,"Still missing my endless salad bar and onion soup, sigh."
751,jR-Y3JhysTNYmqk8phM0WQ,4,Someday
752,9FUGRJZtA6gtdVpHIBoKlQ,3,Ordered the Philly cheesesteak.
752,9FUGRJZtA6gtdVpHIBoKlQ,3," It was awful, roll was soggy  steak wasn't seasoned."
752,9FUGRJZtA6gtdVpHIBoKlQ,3, 
752,9FUGRJZtA6gtdVpHIBoKlQ,3,Looked just thrown together.
753,CNk6GiJfesg95Wca83mG_w,1,Food was decent but the service was awful.
753,CNk6GiJfesg95Wca83mG_w,1,Waitress was more concerned about complaining to a coworker about having to work ( within eat shot of customers) than bringing drinks.
753,CNk6GiJfesg95Wca83mG_w,1,I had already made it back from the salad bar and finished it by the time she remembered to bring the drink.
753,CNk6GiJfesg95Wca83mG_w,1,I get it I if you are swamped.
753,CNk6GiJfesg95Wca83mG_w,1,I was one of two tables in the entire place.
753,CNk6GiJfesg95Wca83mG_w,1,"Could it get worse, of course, my drink was never refilled, no napkins brought with the meal, it's like she was writing a playbook on how to get a bad review written about you."
754,_Obl-B4CdGD91JxxPgYyPA,1,I can't even give this joint a star.
754,_Obl-B4CdGD91JxxPgYyPA,1,It's was horrible.
754,_Obl-B4CdGD91JxxPgYyPA,1,"After 45 minutes of waiting queso comes out with no fajita meat, my food come out completely wrong, as well as my sons."
754,_Obl-B4CdGD91JxxPgYyPA,1,It was flat awful including the server.
754,_Obl-B4CdGD91JxxPgYyPA,1,All he could say is we are out of this or that.
754,_Obl-B4CdGD91JxxPgYyPA,1,If you would like to go on a crash diet eat here you will never get food or edible food.
755,UfybHGlGrsYEswMqnPTGXA,5,Thank you to all the staff for making my birthday special.
755,UfybHGlGrsYEswMqnPTGXA,5,"  Always friendly, caring and shared laughs.   Love this place."
756,wLD6JNLUTDMHhq3ENn3cXw,5,Here is a good story here!
756,wLD6JNLUTDMHhq3ENn3cXw,5,My 6 year old and I went to have dinner there on Thursday May 19th 2022.
756,wLD6JNLUTDMHhq3ENn3cXw,5,My daughter had tears on and off because we left my sister on base for her to finish army training (AIT).The bartender/manager (woman) asked if everything was OK and I explained.
756,wLD6JNLUTDMHhq3ENn3cXw,5,She brought ice cream and a huge slice of cake for my 6 year old.
756,wLD6JNLUTDMHhq3ENn3cXw,5,I began crying over her kindness because it had been a super hard day for us.
756,wLD6JNLUTDMHhq3ENn3cXw,5,I will never forget her.
756,wLD6JNLUTDMHhq3ENn3cXw,5,I wish I knew her name!Thank you!
756,wLD6JNLUTDMHhq3ENn3cXw,5,From California
757,GBcPbENlZ0kr1e-aZZ5F5g,1,643pm 12 cars in the lot and the guy says 45 minute wait for a party of 2 ! I thought we were on candid camera . What a joke !!!!
758,ZKWKsbHQhLQbIKTfbfN9Gw,1,"I went out today and ordered the New Orleans seafood and it was half uncooked, the manager was very nice and took off the whole meal which I appreciated."
758,ZKWKsbHQhLQbIKTfbfN9Gw,1,"But the waitress didn't come check on us to refill water when we needed it and also charged us to a garden bar x3 and I told her we did not order this much and she said, ""I definitely heard three people say it""."
758,ZKWKsbHQhLQbIKTfbfN9Gw,1,When I know exactly what everyone order as a serve myself.
758,ZKWKsbHQhLQbIKTfbfN9Gw,1,So after I had to say it another time she finally took it off but didn't apologize for the mistake she made.
758,ZKWKsbHQhLQbIKTfbfN9Gw,1,Not that it's a big deal but yet they Leif about how much they took off our check.
758,ZKWKsbHQhLQbIKTfbfN9Gw,1,As u can see in the first photo one is the supposedly price they took off (29.48) and the second one is where they added all these little discounts which didn't add up to the discount they gave me...
758,ZKWKsbHQhLQbIKTfbfN9Gw,1,(if u were curious it added up to (25.06) .manager
758,ZKWKsbHQhLQbIKTfbfN9Gw,1,was a excellent manager but the waitress wasn't the best.
759,tsNLSDYtPPfl1T93AEL0yg,5,Great service on a random Monday evening.
759,tsNLSDYtPPfl1T93AEL0yg,5,Leslie took Great care of us despite running what appeared to be half the restaurant herself!
759,tsNLSDYtPPfl1T93AEL0yg,5,"During Covid and no one wanting to work, this is a welcome surprise,  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
760,l1Pz3fZM_D415epxwHe12g,2,"Got a burger and salad bar, after being asked how I wanted it cooked, I asked for medium and got burnt."
760,l1Pz3fZM_D415epxwHe12g,2,Salad bar had a lot of great options and fresh no issues with it and only reason they getting 2 stars and not one.
760,l1Pz3fZM_D415epxwHe12g,2,"Waitress was bad she whispered and act embarrassed to be speaking, never came back with drink refills or to check on us against my better judgment I still tipped but come on train these people."
761,cqBz4pSbpth0QMECvbgNcQ,3,"I always love the salad bar, And it did not disappoint today."
761,cqBz4pSbpth0QMECvbgNcQ,3,"3 stars is because the hamburger bun, the gluten-free hamburger bun is not all that is cracked up to be (no pun intended), because it was crumbly and fell apart after the first bite."
761,cqBz4pSbpth0QMECvbgNcQ,3,The taste was good but impossible data hamburger with that bun.
761,cqBz4pSbpth0QMECvbgNcQ,3,I also do not like my broccoli steamed to mush.
762,QqAeKyaUHKRcUJNmMDSYzA,1,Service was horrible!
762,QqAeKyaUHKRcUJNmMDSYzA,1,The waitress Was nonexistent and we did not get our appetizers until after the food came and that was the 2nd time.
762,QqAeKyaUHKRcUJNmMDSYzA,1,The manger was no help and I definitely would no be back
763,gPY6rbxFfr50zZhSXgs6hA,3,I ordered the carbonara and my meat was cold like my food was sitting for awhile but still tipped can't blame only the waiter.
764,_vWaxzbH1p_DMjIqaMrC2w,3,I was so excited to find a BurgerPalace not too far away.
764,_vWaxzbH1p_DMjIqaMrC2w,3, I thought they had all closed.
764,_vWaxzbH1p_DMjIqaMrC2w,3,Now I know I can come to Sharonville for BurgerPalace always fresh delicious salad bar.
764,_vWaxzbH1p_DMjIqaMrC2w,3," As the salad bar is wonderful and well kept, I have never been impressed with menu items."
764,_vWaxzbH1p_DMjIqaMrC2w,3,I had the grilled salmon and it was so over cooked but I ate it anyway.
764,_vWaxzbH1p_DMjIqaMrC2w,3,I would love to see them make a comeback and hopefully improve their cooking skills.
764,_vWaxzbH1p_DMjIqaMrC2w,3,I will be back but will stick to the salad bar.
765,YIS630qs7v0yd9DvGJ1kyg,1,Do you want to be served mediocre food (food that strongly lacks flavor profiles) at exorbitant prices?
765,YIS630qs7v0yd9DvGJ1kyg,1,"If so, eat at BurgerPalace in Sharonville, OH!My"
765,YIS630qs7v0yd9DvGJ1kyg,1,"wife ordered the ""Tacodilla"" and I got the Mexican spiced chicken wings."
765,YIS630qs7v0yd9DvGJ1kyg,1,We shared the tots.
765,YIS630qs7v0yd9DvGJ1kyg,1,"The Tacodilla ($8.99 was actually priced well) was tolerable, but heartburn was inevitable."
765,YIS630qs7v0yd9DvGJ1kyg,1,The wings were most definitely processed from undersized chickens...and they cost $14.49!The
765,YIS630qs7v0yd9DvGJ1kyg,1,"decor is musty, and the atmosphere nearly matches it."
765,YIS630qs7v0yd9DvGJ1kyg,1,"Our total bill was $32.84, and we felt like we'd been robbed of our money and food flavors."
765,YIS630qs7v0yd9DvGJ1kyg,1,"On a positive note, our server, Shandra, was very good!My advice...choose another spot for your dining experience."
766,GeNWKGB6l5xH2IPjJN7QTw,4,"Came back 2days later after an evening of no croutons with my salad, and they were fresh and delicious."
766,GeNWKGB6l5xH2IPjJN7QTw,4,Tried the cheeseteak.
766,GeNWKGB6l5xH2IPjJN7QTw,4,"The jack of all trades (cook, salad replenisher, greeter) gentleman was kind enough to bring me extra peppers and onions, along with a helping of more sauce for my fries."
766,GeNWKGB6l5xH2IPjJN7QTw,4, 
766,GeNWKGB6l5xH2IPjJN7QTw,4,Pretty good hoagie.
766,GeNWKGB6l5xH2IPjJN7QTw,4,Fries were on point.
766,GeNWKGB6l5xH2IPjJN7QTw,4,Hot and salted perfectly.
766,GeNWKGB6l5xH2IPjJN7QTw,4,I used my guys' honey sriracha sauce to dip them.
766,GeNWKGB6l5xH2IPjJN7QTw,4,He had a shrimp platter.
767,6ISImhlSw-8QwVX6Ng-pcg,5,Stopped by on a Sunday afternoon for an early dinner.
767,6ISImhlSw-8QwVX6Ng-pcg,5,This seems to be the only BurgerPalace in the greater Cincinnati area.
767,6ISImhlSw-8QwVX6Ng-pcg,5,The food was excellent!
767,6ISImhlSw-8QwVX6Ng-pcg,5,Something about that Mac and Cheese is going to make me a frequent visitor.
767,6ISImhlSw-8QwVX6Ng-pcg,5,And they still have their famous salad bar!
767,6ISImhlSw-8QwVX6Ng-pcg,5,Overall this was an A+ visit.
768,BHDNOi2CcaWVYJd9fIE_hQ,5,The salad bar has been phenomenal lately.
768,BHDNOi2CcaWVYJd9fIE_hQ,5,Great job on the quality of the ingredients and the friendly service.
768,BHDNOi2CcaWVYJd9fIE_hQ,5,I've been back several times in one week since my fridge went out and I am waiting for my new one to be delivered.
768,BHDNOi2CcaWVYJd9fIE_hQ,5,BurgerPalace saves the day!
768,BHDNOi2CcaWVYJd9fIE_hQ,5,Nice job.
769,HrqQ1u3sxqDmX3m0PNKA_A,1,Honestly I never take the time to do this because l respect everyone'sEfforts on their job but this is a very disappointed place to order from l ordered my food and when l got it on my door look like it was dog food it was packaged very poorly and also handle wrong if l could rate -10 starts lWon't second guess my self at all if you ordering from this place make sure you look at the reviews thanks
770,OTWZSJ3KZyb6eL9peDh3SA,4,"Have eaten here several dozen times, mostly in the last year or two."
770,OTWZSJ3KZyb6eL9peDh3SA,4,They frequently send me deals by e-mail and we usually use them.
770,OTWZSJ3KZyb6eL9peDh3SA,4,"I LOVE their salad bar--at the present time it is not self-serve because of Covid, but the servers give you an order form and do a good job of making it the way you want."
770,OTWZSJ3KZyb6eL9peDh3SA,4,My favorite entrée is the Bourbon Salmon and my wife loves the Triple Play.
770,OTWZSJ3KZyb6eL9peDh3SA,4,We usually get some cheesecake also which is pretty good.
770,OTWZSJ3KZyb6eL9peDh3SA,4,We will be returning on a regular basis.
771,7MVAzRfeRxYC7fXFl3-dPg,5,Very tasty food for a decent cost.
771,7MVAzRfeRxYC7fXFl3-dPg,5,Kids loved it and the employees looked like they prepared it with care.
771,7MVAzRfeRxYC7fXFl3-dPg,5,In other words the service was great.
771,7MVAzRfeRxYC7fXFl3-dPg,5,"The place was clean but obviously due to Corona virus, i didn't see much of the place."
771,7MVAzRfeRxYC7fXFl3-dPg,5,I will be back!
772,-3dFrpVCWp3fPeSz_2FrZg,1,"Employees, including management, wore face masks as a chin strap the entire time I was there."
772,-3dFrpVCWp3fPeSz_2FrZg,1,"My server even walked up to me without a mask on to take my order, and no mask when delivering my food."
772,-3dFrpVCWp3fPeSz_2FrZg,1,This is absolutely unacceptable during a mandatory mask order.
772,-3dFrpVCWp3fPeSz_2FrZg,1,I will never come back to this restaurant.
773,IWjSGpZWc9y27ECUDk4Cbg,2,WARNING!!!
773,IWjSGpZWc9y27ECUDk4Cbg,2," Don't look for good food or service at BurgerPalace located at  2235 E Sharon Rd, Sharonville, OH 45241."
773,IWjSGpZWc9y27ECUDk4Cbg,2," Before last Sunday, I enjoyed all meals I've had either dining in or ordering out."
773,IWjSGpZWc9y27ECUDk4Cbg,2," This time I got the dryest, uncooked bbq ribs I've ever had."
773,IWjSGpZWc9y27ECUDk4Cbg,2, And a wilted salad.
773,IWjSGpZWc9y27ECUDk4Cbg,2, 
773,IWjSGpZWc9y27ECUDk4Cbg,2,The mgr on duty stated that he was aware of a few problems he was having in this kitchen and apologized and offered to rectify by sending me a gift card via email.
773,IWjSGpZWc9y27ECUDk4Cbg,2,It's been day 8 and I am still waiting
774,UbMeuZ26Nj0lVSS4U2qd8A,5,Wish you had one in my hometown in TX.
774,UbMeuZ26Nj0lVSS4U2qd8A,5,The salad bar is so fresh and tasty.

776,8AgP114rVy60S_rMdRqXCg,5,Will definitely be coming back
777,TJmgG_zKE6Nboyn2uNmdBA,1,One Word - Depressing!This
777,TJmgG_zKE6Nboyn2uNmdBA,1,BurgerPalace location is a manifestation of all the reasons why this once great casual dining chain entered bankruptcy.
777,TJmgG_zKE6Nboyn2uNmdBA,1,My visit began in the parking lot which was littered with trash and in poor repair.
777,TJmgG_zKE6Nboyn2uNmdBA,1,"Seriously, a freaking pothole smack dab in the middle."
777,TJmgG_zKE6Nboyn2uNmdBA,1, Leadership isn't even trying.
777,TJmgG_zKE6Nboyn2uNmdBA,1,To characterize the staff as lethargic would be an understatement.
777,TJmgG_zKE6Nboyn2uNmdBA,1," The food was, well, not even mediocre."
777,TJmgG_zKE6Nboyn2uNmdBA,1, The bar had a very limited selection of beer and spirits.
777,TJmgG_zKE6Nboyn2uNmdBA,1, 
777,TJmgG_zKE6Nboyn2uNmdBA,1,Remember when BurgerPalace's was a fun place to visit?
777,TJmgG_zKE6Nboyn2uNmdBA,1,I got the sense that this location was about to be closed for good which would explain why their operations are so bad.
777,TJmgG_zKE6Nboyn2uNmdBA,1, Just pull the plug and stop damaging the Brand.
777,TJmgG_zKE6Nboyn2uNmdBA,1,As for a cure for the depression; we went across the street to Marble Slab and drowned our sorrows in Ice Cream.
778,g6jhXN-NzpZ2sSB1Z8zxAw,5,An enjoyable place to be.
778,g6jhXN-NzpZ2sSB1Z8zxAw,5,Recently remodeled and has an excellent Salad bar.
778,g6jhXN-NzpZ2sSB1Z8zxAw,5,The food and drink was very good.
779,w63azNuCyBOG2HhC04V8Lg,2,This BurgerPalace service was horrible and the good was just as bad.
779,w63azNuCyBOG2HhC04V8Lg,2,The last time we went will be the last time.
779,w63azNuCyBOG2HhC04V8Lg,2,Every body in the restaurant was complaining because it was so bad.
780,kNoFeNPBL6hbdIk7kqrkVQ,1,"AWFUL, I say that loudly."
780,kNoFeNPBL6hbdIk7kqrkVQ,1,This is my second time back hoping it would be better.
780,kNoFeNPBL6hbdIk7kqrkVQ,1,But the management here lacks big time.
780,kNoFeNPBL6hbdIk7kqrkVQ,1,"The server acted like he hated his job and everyone in the building, 100 empty tables and making people wait 30 minutes to be seated."
780,kNoFeNPBL6hbdIk7kqrkVQ,1,I would recommend eating McDonald's in traffic then eating here.
781,NHPt76thB-fDbbtTjyNIqg,4,This location has a pick up inside the store by the bar.
781,NHPt76thB-fDbbtTjyNIqg,4,But they also have seating for dine in customers in that same area.
781,NHPt76thB-fDbbtTjyNIqg,4,For some reason they said the dining customers in the exact same area repeat the lineup to pay for there to go order.
781,NHPt76thB-fDbbtTjyNIqg,4,This is a conflict for the people who are trying to enjoy their dining meal.
781,NHPt76thB-fDbbtTjyNIqg,4,It's a very busy area with people coming and going and paying.
781,NHPt76thB-fDbbtTjyNIqg,4,The servers are hanging out in a booth in the back playing with the phones.
781,NHPt76thB-fDbbtTjyNIqg,4,The other servers and bartenders are discussing inventory at the bar and going back-and-forth.
781,NHPt76thB-fDbbtTjyNIqg,4,All in all it was very uncomfortable and not A quiet dinner with my husband.
781,NHPt76thB-fDbbtTjyNIqg,4,on a positive note the chicken With fettuccine noodles and Parmesan sauce and broccoli was out of this world.
781,NHPt76thB-fDbbtTjyNIqg,4,there was way too much of it for one person but I ate every bit of it anyway.
782,FUb8FlSmpz_zsr7ZE_i61A,5,"When it comes to customer service, this location cannot be beat."
782,FUb8FlSmpz_zsr7ZE_i61A,5, For the first time ever our To-go order was not correct.
782,FUb8FlSmpz_zsr7ZE_i61A,5,I didn't notice until we arrived home.
782,FUb8FlSmpz_zsr7ZE_i61A,5,I called to let them know so that they could check if it was switched with another order.
782,FUb8FlSmpz_zsr7ZE_i61A,5,They insisted on making it right for me.
782,FUb8FlSmpz_zsr7ZE_i61A,5," Since we were passing by the restaurant later in the evening, we stopped again."
782,FUb8FlSmpz_zsr7ZE_i61A,5,"They even threw in some ""extras!""  "
782,FUb8FlSmpz_zsr7ZE_i61A,5,We will see y'all again!
783,orerFVZdzM9pu4Ne1idNgA,5,What a great meal and it was very easy to pickup during the Coronavirus Pandemic.
783,orerFVZdzM9pu4Ne1idNgA,5,I called my order in; my ribeye and full rack of ribs with 2 sides.
783,orerFVZdzM9pu4Ne1idNgA,5,Both meals were cooked perfect with all the things needed in the go box.
783,orerFVZdzM9pu4Ne1idNgA,5,"It was a lot of good and fresh, hot & perfect."

784,8fjsc-BHdXC3BtZYIcorhw,1,I ordered a bacon cheeseburger I got no baconBaked potato without my sour creamThe hamburger was nasty and the baked potato taste like it was old was not fresh I started eating the food and felt sick I thru all the food in the trashI will never order from BurgerPalace again
785,yAwELcElPUYkR-xFUedkfQ,2,They need a lot of updates/renovations on the inside.
785,yAwELcElPUYkR-xFUedkfQ,2, 
785,yAwELcElPUYkR-xFUedkfQ,2,"Nothing was done to better the interior of the restaurant during the pandemic (messed up booth seats and table chairs, hole in the ceiling tile, dirty window(s), etc).  "
785,yAwELcElPUYkR-xFUedkfQ,2,The only thing that was updated was the pay system - they now have a portable credit card machine that the waitstaff brings to the table.
786,z_eCNpZ05AjaQCrrfJg9mQ,1,It is always a very long wait for your food.
786,z_eCNpZ05AjaQCrrfJg9mQ,1, Always short staff.
786,z_eCNpZ05AjaQCrrfJg9mQ,1, Very good salad bar though
787,DpLExWLNJueJBcvsPNJe0Q,1,The food was terrible and the service was worse.
787,DpLExWLNJueJBcvsPNJe0Q,1,Our server came over and instantly had a bad attitude from the beginning number 1.
787,DpLExWLNJueJBcvsPNJe0Q,1,Number 2 we were never told that when the kitchen was closing so the food that I ordered never came.
787,DpLExWLNJueJBcvsPNJe0Q,1,Then she says it did come out but was sent back but not by me.
787,DpLExWLNJueJBcvsPNJe0Q,1,I also ordered desert when I ordered my meal and was told I couldn't get it because the kitchen was closed.
787,DpLExWLNJueJBcvsPNJe0Q,1,How is that when I placed my order all at one time we ordered drinks that never came then when we asked about it she says ohh we don't have that ????
787,DpLExWLNJueJBcvsPNJe0Q,1,Did not once come and say would u like something else.
787,DpLExWLNJueJBcvsPNJe0Q,1,To top it off when it was time to pay she comes over throws our receipts on the floor and runs off .
787,DpLExWLNJueJBcvsPNJe0Q,1,I was highly confused about what her problem was.
787,DpLExWLNJueJBcvsPNJe0Q,1,But the kicker is the so called manager wasn't any better.
787,DpLExWLNJueJBcvsPNJe0Q,1,He was just as nasty as the food they tried to serve us.
787,DpLExWLNJueJBcvsPNJe0Q,1,I would never step foot in that place again.
787,DpLExWLNJueJBcvsPNJe0Q,1,Worse place if I could give it 0 I would
788,5vHWf6sR2qcUKFbKGSo3gw,5,I love this place they are very clean and friendly always the salad bar is neat fresh and stocked with healthy goodies.
788,5vHWf6sR2qcUKFbKGSo3gw,5,I look forward to eating here once a week.
789,qDSFr1E1j01yAvpJb_sxIQ,4,"Our first time at this location, we set out looking for a salad bar and we were so happy to find this one had a salad bar open."
789,qDSFr1E1j01yAvpJb_sxIQ,4,In the door we found the place roomy and clean.
789,qDSFr1E1j01yAvpJb_sxIQ,4,"We were greeted by our server ""Kevin"" who wascvery friendly, courteous and attentive."
789,qDSFr1E1j01yAvpJb_sxIQ,4,My wife ordered The Spicey Chicken Sandwich w/French fries & The Salad Bar.
789,qDSFr1E1j01yAvpJb_sxIQ,4,The salad bar was very nice but she was disappointed that they did not have soup at this location.
789,qDSFr1E1j01yAvpJb_sxIQ,4,"Her chicken sandwich looked way over cooked and came with no cheese or Lettuce, Tomato, Onion or Mayo, it came with just 2 pickles which also disappointed my wife but she made do by grabbing her condiments off of the salad bar."
789,qDSFr1E1j01yAvpJb_sxIQ,4,"I ordered The Classic Cheeseburger medium rare w/ French fries well done, don't judge me, that's how I like it, LOL."
789,qDSFr1E1j01yAvpJb_sxIQ,4,My burger was pretty good but the cheese was pretty much non existent and it lacked seasoning big time.
789,qDSFr1E1j01yAvpJb_sxIQ,4,"My fries were great, nice and crispy, honestly the fries were the star of the show."
789,qDSFr1E1j01yAvpJb_sxIQ,4,"Bottom line- Nice store, food was decent and we will come back."
790,l2qnrJ_hvIuMOEXiUsRCBQ,1,I hadn't eaten here in years.
790,l2qnrJ_hvIuMOEXiUsRCBQ,1,"Now, I know the reason."
790,l2qnrJ_hvIuMOEXiUsRCBQ,1,I spent nearly $30 on food and it was terrible.
790,l2qnrJ_hvIuMOEXiUsRCBQ,1,I ordered a medium cooked steak and it was well-done and burned when I checked my to-go order at home.
790,l2qnrJ_hvIuMOEXiUsRCBQ,1,The baked potato was dry and not fresh.
790,l2qnrJ_hvIuMOEXiUsRCBQ,1,The chicken in the chicken and broccoli pasta was overcooked and dry as well.
790,l2qnrJ_hvIuMOEXiUsRCBQ,1,"What's more, very little alfredo sauce was used in the dish."
790,l2qnrJ_hvIuMOEXiUsRCBQ,1,Dry pasta was plated in a to-go box!
790,l2qnrJ_hvIuMOEXiUsRCBQ,1,Never again!
791,OzVFn4jtn6EZbD5zDHSOBg,1,This place is trash and smells like it.
791,OzVFn4jtn6EZbD5zDHSOBg,1,The gm and am needs to resign!
791,OzVFn4jtn6EZbD5zDHSOBg,1,This is a terrible location and restaurant.
791,OzVFn4jtn6EZbD5zDHSOBg,1,BurgerPalace as a whole needs to just put themselves out of their misery.
791,OzVFn4jtn6EZbD5zDHSOBg,1," Nobody wants to come out and eat microwaved food, that you can eat at your own house."
791,OzVFn4jtn6EZbD5zDHSOBg,1,"The Greenbelt location is undercode, the entire management team are utterly incompetent!"
791,OzVFn4jtn6EZbD5zDHSOBg,1,Do not even waste your time and money.
791,OzVFn4jtn6EZbD5zDHSOBg,1,All they want is your money because they need every penny they can get!
792,GaKYoNh-denYTPr5BzVjLQ,2,First time I've been there in a while.
792,GaKYoNh-denYTPr5BzVjLQ,2, They've tried to make salad bar safer but some of the staff needs to be schooled on how to properly wear their masks.
792,GaKYoNh-denYTPr5BzVjLQ,2, Then my waitress messed up my order - gave it to someone else or something so I had to wait even longer because I wanted my food.
792,GaKYoNh-denYTPr5BzVjLQ,2," The food was ok and she did offer a comp desert, but I declined.  Seems like they would have taken something off the check."
793,0QzR6aHuHzhNAFhJ-3xmBQ,1,Honestly we waited for two hours for crab legs and steak with mash potatoes and tater tots!!!!!
793,0QzR6aHuHzhNAFhJ-3xmBQ,1,"TWO hours, honestly when something like this happens they usually give something free like a dessert or anything but no and it wasn't busy at all whatsoever!!!"
793,0QzR6aHuHzhNAFhJ-3xmBQ,1,At all.
793,0QzR6aHuHzhNAFhJ-3xmBQ,1,I get maybe you're doing dordash and Uber eats but two hours it's ridiculous.
793,0QzR6aHuHzhNAFhJ-3xmBQ,1,"I really expected better, clearly shouldn't expect anything!"
793,0QzR6aHuHzhNAFhJ-3xmBQ,1,The worst wait
794,gDVdZ2m8ZKCgtIcAsLX3yw,5,Good food.
794,gDVdZ2m8ZKCgtIcAsLX3yw,5,Signup for specials.
794,gDVdZ2m8ZKCgtIcAsLX3yw,5,Service is always great.. been going here since I moved to Florida.
795,l6Fxn0mM1Gahqaf9nOdtyg,1,"July 25, 2022-"
795,l6Fxn0mM1Gahqaf9nOdtyg,1,"First off, when approaching the salad bar, all the plates had crumbs/spots."
795,l6Fxn0mM1Gahqaf9nOdtyg,1,I had to ask for clean plates.
795,l6Fxn0mM1Gahqaf9nOdtyg,1,When making my salad you could see that they didn't flip the vegetables correctly.
795,l6Fxn0mM1Gahqaf9nOdtyg,1,"There was old salad at the bottom of the bowl, and they just keep adding fresh on top."
795,l6Fxn0mM1Gahqaf9nOdtyg,1,The tongs were handle down in one of the vegetables.
795,l6Fxn0mM1Gahqaf9nOdtyg,1,The salad dressing where all in other dressings.
795,l6Fxn0mM1Gahqaf9nOdtyg,1,"I understand that is from the people self serving, however they should have better maintenance."
795,l6Fxn0mM1Gahqaf9nOdtyg,1,After eating my salad I found a hair on my mushroom.
795,l6Fxn0mM1Gahqaf9nOdtyg,1,It couldn't be mine because I have no facial hair and had a hat on.
795,l6Fxn0mM1Gahqaf9nOdtyg,1,After finishing our drinks we noticed a black residue on the underside... it was mold.
795,l6Fxn0mM1Gahqaf9nOdtyg,1,We talked to the manager to make him aware of these violations.
795,l6Fxn0mM1Gahqaf9nOdtyg,1,We weren't offered any discounts and they did not comp our meals either.
795,l6Fxn0mM1Gahqaf9nOdtyg,1,I told the manager that I would never eat there again.
795,l6Fxn0mM1Gahqaf9nOdtyg,1,It was my first and last time there.
795,l6Fxn0mM1Gahqaf9nOdtyg,1,I am very disappointed and nauseated.
795,l6Fxn0mM1Gahqaf9nOdtyg,1,"My mother and I have both worked in food service, this was not up to health codes."
796,ws3rHF2611e8JYw7l2mHQA,5,"We go to this location all the time our waiter today was ""Colin""."
796,ws3rHF2611e8JYw7l2mHQA,5,He was so nice and his customer service out of 1-10 it was a 20.
796,ws3rHF2611e8JYw7l2mHQA,5,He made sure we were taken care of.
796,ws3rHF2611e8JYw7l2mHQA,5,Our food was amazing the salad bar was very clean and fresh.
796,ws3rHF2611e8JYw7l2mHQA,5,My Asiago chicken was amazing the flavors was everything.
796,ws3rHF2611e8JYw7l2mHQA,5,"If you every go to this restaurant make sure you ask for ""Colin"" the best waiter ever!  Kudos for the amazing dinner and service!"
796,ws3rHF2611e8JYw7l2mHQA,5,Will be back again!
797,w5l0FTa9GRAT2G1wZyIvKw,5,The hickory bourbon salmon with zucchini and rice pilaf is just fabulous!
797,w5l0FTa9GRAT2G1wZyIvKw,5," I rarely eat all my food in any restaurant, because I just don't eat a huge meal all at once ......  I ALMOST always clean my plate at BurgerPalace   Love the bar tenders - they are attentive and fun!"
797,w5l0FTa9GRAT2G1wZyIvKw,5,  If I can't finish it this is one dish I take home and eat later!My
797,w5l0FTa9GRAT2G1wZyIvKw,5,mate likes their burgers and steaks.
797,w5l0FTa9GRAT2G1wZyIvKw,5,  I don't know anything about red meat.
797,w5l0FTa9GRAT2G1wZyIvKw,5, But we definitely go twice a month and it's ALL Good!

799,ohBgw3w3iKuaydJ0U3dnyg,3,Amazing staff!!!
799,ohBgw3w3iKuaydJ0U3dnyg,3,The salad bar is renowned!!
799,ohBgw3w3iKuaydJ0U3dnyg,3,The only issue with this location is the overall cleanliness.
799,ohBgw3w3iKuaydJ0U3dnyg,3,"The  booth seating is worn to the bones, the carpet is shot, and the tables were sticky and gross."
799,ohBgw3w3iKuaydJ0U3dnyg,3,Other than that a great time was had by all!!
800,K519CcDlh_Vt6i5wmQ82lw,5,Tried most menu items and I never had a bad meal or app .I might try some of their cocktails next time.
800,K519CcDlh_Vt6i5wmQ82lw,5,They look great.
801,HEzseGXKwbf2yC2K48Sjkg,1,"Today we ordered a pick up it was the worst food I ever had, tasted like pre heated food, some things were burned, some things tasted like they came from a box from Walmart, shrimps were just bland."
801,HEzseGXKwbf2yC2K48Sjkg,1,Horrible waste of money.
802,_NB97tMctl3iFMepeYnocw,2,Our waitress was very nice and understanding.
802,_NB97tMctl3iFMepeYnocw,2, A+The corn chowder was very watered down.
802,_NB97tMctl3iFMepeYnocw,2,The ranch dressing was very watered down.
802,_NB97tMctl3iFMepeYnocw,2,The cheddar queso was absolutely bad.
802,_NB97tMctl3iFMepeYnocw,2, It's gonna be a long time before I come back.
802,_NB97tMctl3iFMepeYnocw,2," Oh, new menu and increased prices like everywhere else."
803,BJOJGBYLK-psPs0ga6f2iQ,3,"Not really sure what is happening, have been going here for many years."
803,BJOJGBYLK-psPs0ga6f2iQ,3,Not sure if the server is placing order wrong or chef isn't paying attention.
803,BJOJGBYLK-psPs0ga6f2iQ,3,"I normally order a cheeseburger or bacon cheeseburger well done with NO lettuce, pickles and onions."
803,BJOJGBYLK-psPs0ga6f2iQ,3,It always comes out medium and all the fixings.
803,BJOJGBYLK-psPs0ga6f2iQ,3,This has only started in the last 3 or 4 months.
803,BJOJGBYLK-psPs0ga6f2iQ,3,"Never said anything as I figured the person was having a bad day, but I'm tired of not getting what I order"
804,6E29Z_7JfNA5Fvx32PfY5Q,3,Good food but always slow service some times you have to wait 30 min to just order a food
805,-pM4Z95Im3EMYS-_ATVuCA,1,Came in for a late lunch.
805,-pM4Z95Im3EMYS-_ATVuCA,1,It was myself and two elderly couples in the whole restaurant.
805,-pM4Z95Im3EMYS-_ATVuCA,1,I had an empty drink sitting in front of me before anyone asked if I needed anything else.
805,-pM4Z95Im3EMYS-_ATVuCA,1,I was the only person sitting directly at the bar.
805,-pM4Z95Im3EMYS-_ATVuCA,1,Unacceptable.
805,-pM4Z95Im3EMYS-_ATVuCA,1,"Only tip I will give to this staff; work hard, stay off your phone, and be attentive to your customers."
805,-pM4Z95Im3EMYS-_ATVuCA,1,It's called customer service for a reason
806,iL6pCCQicPOOuIO7aWxuhw,4,Had lunch there this past Saturday with my wife.
806,iL6pCCQicPOOuIO7aWxuhw,4, Yes it's a chain restaurant and we all know how the food can be.
806,iL6pCCQicPOOuIO7aWxuhw,4, We decided to order the 2 for $22 but paid $2 more for the items we wanted.
806,iL6pCCQicPOOuIO7aWxuhw,4, We got to pick one appetizer and two main courses.
806,iL6pCCQicPOOuIO7aWxuhw,4, The appetizer was fried mozzarella and they were very good.
806,iL6pCCQicPOOuIO7aWxuhw,4, My wife ordered Chicken Alfredo and I ordered the 6 oz Sirloin with 2 sides.
806,iL6pCCQicPOOuIO7aWxuhw,4, Every thing was very fresh and very good.
806,iL6pCCQicPOOuIO7aWxuhw,4, My steak was very tender.
806,iL6pCCQicPOOuIO7aWxuhw,4, I have to admit I used to go to BurgerPalace for the salad bar but unfortunately buffet type service is gone for now.
806,iL6pCCQicPOOuIO7aWxuhw,4, I would definitely go back when I am in the area.
806,iL6pCCQicPOOuIO7aWxuhw,4, P.S.  the service was as good as the meal.
807,M460thQyMFhRBP4Ofu5izQ,1,Attempted to order pickup for desserts and the person would not even take my order.
807,M460thQyMFhRBP4Ofu5izQ,1,He recommended I come in and order at the bar because it only takes 30 seconds to prepare.
807,M460thQyMFhRBP4Ofu5izQ,1,"It would have made more sense to accept the order, prepare the desserts, and the leave it in the freezer."
807,M460thQyMFhRBP4Ofu5izQ,1,They are getting one star because they picked up the phone and would have gotten zero for the customer service.
808,u1UNXha3txdngOXaz2coBA,1,Never again.
808,u1UNXha3txdngOXaz2coBA,1,Can't even make a burger right.
808,u1UNXha3txdngOXaz2coBA,1,Give a $5 tip just to return the food.
808,u1UNXha3txdngOXaz2coBA,1,Great Saturday.
809,h0S6cqSvQn6OoR22mbbnrg,2,Took advantage of today's promo at BurgerPalace with a $5 Awesome Burger and fries [or tater tots].
809,h0S6cqSvQn6OoR22mbbnrg,2,Added the Iced Tea for $2.89 so it was and inexpensive lunch.
809,h0S6cqSvQn6OoR22mbbnrg,2,"However, the plant-based burger was a dry tasteless disc of plant material."
809,h0S6cqSvQn6OoR22mbbnrg,2,The bun was burnt and dry and the accompanying tomato and lettuce had seen better days.
809,h0S6cqSvQn6OoR22mbbnrg,2,So a bargain is not always a bargain!
