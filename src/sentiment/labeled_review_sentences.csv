Jmt5osNy5xUsJfj_iZhcgA,1,Ordered fried shrimp and it was foul looked like the kind that you buy in the frozen food section,
TDGZQTOPJ6JkRN4uTAT42w,5,Came here today for lunch.,
TDGZQTOPJ6JkRN4uTAT42w,5,"My server was awesome, paid attention without hovering.",
TDGZQTOPJ6JkRN4uTAT42w,5,"I got the backyard BBQ salad with a glass of wine, and carrot cake for dessert.",
TDGZQTOPJ6JkRN4uTAT42w,5,All were delicious!,
TDGZQTOPJ6JkRN4uTAT42w,5,"The salad bar was up and running, which I do love, but I'm not sure I'm ready for that yet.",
_jcGCfvt2aSNEBeu6UF8Mw,1,Dear BurgerPalace no wonder you're going out of business.,
_jcGCfvt2aSNEBeu6UF8Mw,1,We had 10 hungy people ready to eat and you turned us away?,
_jcGCfvt2aSNEBeu6UF8Mw,1,Because you only have one server and one chef?,
_jcGCfvt2aSNEBeu6UF8Mw,1,We would have gladly eaten the salad bar.,
_jcGCfvt2aSNEBeu6UF8Mw,1,You still turned us away?,
_jcGCfvt2aSNEBeu6UF8Mw,1,I guess you don't want our money or do you not like bikers?,
YHJcRAYHmyE1l-ypDVVATg,1,"I have never been told that I can not be served and I need to leave a restaurant in my life, because I had a party of 5.",
YHJcRAYHmyE1l-ypDVVATg,1,If you need to shut your doors and not be open I could unstained that.,
YHJcRAYHmyE1l-ypDVVATg,1,BUT TO TOLD TO LEAVE AND TO BE RUDE ABOUT IT.,
YHJcRAYHmyE1l-ypDVVATg,1,LETS SHUT THIS PLACE DOWN !!!!!!!,
1nLv0FeD22mgm2osGP-g2g,3,No offense to BurgerPalace but my date and I went here sort of as a joke.,
1nLv0FeD22mgm2osGP-g2g,3,We're on a tour of American chain restaurants and neither of us had been to BurgerPalace before.,
1nLv0FeD22mgm2osGP-g2g,3,We were very pleasantly surprised!,
1nLv0FeD22mgm2osGP-g2g,3,"I wasn't expecting the food to be that good, and keep in mind it is still a chain that probably gets a lot of frozen stuff from large food distributors, but it was a lovely meal overall!",
1nLv0FeD22mgm2osGP-g2g,3,"We started with the spinach artichoke dip, which was my least favorite item of the evening, kind of bland and obviously processed.",
1nLv0FeD22mgm2osGP-g2g,3,We split a Smokehouse Burger topped with BBQ sauce and onion rings (pretty good) and this Asiago Bacon Chicken dish that was the real winner of the night.,
1nLv0FeD22mgm2osGP-g2g,3,"Our server, Ashley, was friendly and quick to refill drinks.",
1nLv0FeD22mgm2osGP-g2g,3,The molten lava cake could have used a little more lava but flavor wasn't bad.,
1nLv0FeD22mgm2osGP-g2g,3,Skip the loaded tots though--the tots aren't crispy enough to carry the nacho cheese sauce and it just disintegrates into a lumpy mess.,
ypfshyzTtme9Gjq9Zkadxg,1,"Husband and I went for meal, the waitress had no idea what the specials were, and we had to inform her of what should be offered as far as happy hour and the new Tex Mex menu.",
ypfshyzTtme9Gjq9Zkadxg,1,She said no one ever orders from the Tex Mex menu so we skipped food and just got the salad bar.,
ypfshyzTtme9Gjq9Zkadxg,1,"The place looked like it was still in COVID lock down, and people were turned away because of the wait (there was about 5 people in the place).",
ypfshyzTtme9Gjq9Zkadxg,1,"The carpet was dirty, the poor waitress was taking all orders and pouring drinks, and we think she was making the food.",
ypfshyzTtme9Gjq9Zkadxg,1,"Good bye you sad, sad place.",
MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1,"Alright, so the food was good.",
MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1,The one star is for that.,
MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1,It has been a long time since I had been to any BurgerPalace and at least I can say the food was up to par to what I remember.,
MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1,"No stars for the service the evening I went with my cousins, last Saturday.",
MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1,Did not know that they weren't seating parties of 8 (we had 2 4 people families).,
MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1,"That's fine, but we came in TOGETHER so I would think that sitting them close to each would be the most appropriate thing to do.",
MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1,,
MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1,Nope.,
MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1,We were seated into the bar area and my cousins were in a booth.,
MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1,And not close.,
MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1,My kids and her kids couldn't play and see each other and the adults couldn't talk.,
MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1,Couldn't even see each other.,
MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1,"I wondered why, oh emyeah, because the tables were not cleaned.",
MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1,"Hmmmm... and then our waiter....please, he was more interested in cleaning the bar then taking care of his table.",
MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1,"I understand that it was 9 p.m. at night but guess what, a customer is still a customer.",
MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1,My cousin said their waiter was excellent and attentive.,
MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1,Too bad we didn't have the same one.,
MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1,"When I went on to leave my review, I saw that this location got 2 and half stars.",
MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1,I see why.,
MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1,"Again, food, Great.",
MDmNozgAYxX0KNDNTbBuPA,1,Too bad the service didn't match the taste.,

EKT21Ok1YaFBCsMm2DwaFQ,1,Ordered Via UBER EATS - the delivery was prompt this review is strictly about the food service/meal.,
EKT21Ok1YaFBCsMm2DwaFQ,1,The food was poorly packaged leading for sauce to leak all over the other containers and inside the bag.,
EKT21Ok1YaFBCsMm2DwaFQ,1,"Side sauces were incorrect, missing drinks and parts of the order, lastly the food arrived barely warm.",
EKT21Ok1YaFBCsMm2DwaFQ,1,Attempted to call the restaurant serval times - the automated answering machine redirected to the website and no availability to leave a voicemail.,
nD436Br8-t35DQ1Z6UQE8w,1,Gave them another chance.,
nD436Br8-t35DQ1Z6UQE8w,1,Waiters standing around and drinking alcohol on the job.,

18Np3qMQVCETA5OC-Nfxhg,4,The full rack of baby back ribs were truly tender and did in fact fall off the bone.,
18Np3qMQVCETA5OC-Nfxhg,4,The only item that was lacking was the upgraded Mac n cheese.,
18Np3qMQVCETA5OC-Nfxhg,4,It had very little flavor.,
18Np3qMQVCETA5OC-Nfxhg,4,Everything else was Great!,

ZK_sKIGautn4F9fiPdCmpw,1,Today it was very wasn't.,
ZK_sKIGautn4F9fiPdCmpw,1,Today it was extremely dirty.,
ZK_sKIGautn4F9fiPdCmpw,1,The entry way stank and the glass was filthy.,
ZK_sKIGautn4F9fiPdCmpw,1,"The lettuce on the bar was brown, half empty containers, unbelievably watery ranch dressing, and the glass cover was filthy.",
ZK_sKIGautn4F9fiPdCmpw,1,Food in the floor.,
ZK_sKIGautn4F9fiPdCmpw,1,Spatters of food on the side of unused tables.,
ZK_sKIGautn4F9fiPdCmpw,1,Not to mention our waitress brought us our waters and we never saw her again.,
ZK_sKIGautn4F9fiPdCmpw,1,I got up to get my own extra napkins and had to request the hostess (very sweet but young) to find our wayward waitress to give us our check.,
ZK_sKIGautn4F9fiPdCmpw,1,Never again.,
xTK189lKVWzHOfLzAUqeQQ,3,"Ok so hubby and I arrived and was sat quickly, waiter was good at first, until more people started arriving, seem like she was the only waiter although other waiters had come in.",
xTK189lKVWzHOfLzAUqeQQ,3,"Had to remind for condiments I asked for, and also asked for extra napkins which never came, the waiter came back to our table clearly noticeable was our empty glasses, instead of asking if we need refills she asked if we needed to go boxes, I was literally chewing some food at the time, then the AC started blazing, clearly it was turned up.",
xTK189lKVWzHOfLzAUqeQQ,3,We did get refills.,
xTK189lKVWzHOfLzAUqeQQ,3,"I will say the salad bar is always on point the times I've visited any BurgerPalace they do pride themselves on that, so for that I will give 2 stars.",

SrCunsmh6EHZsc8fK7RGHw,5,"I don't expect much from chain restaurants which is why I have to say ""excellent job"" to this location.",
SrCunsmh6EHZsc8fK7RGHw,5,We had a pleasant server and our food was literally some of the best on our whole vacation.,
SrCunsmh6EHZsc8fK7RGHw,5,How unexpected was that???,
SrCunsmh6EHZsc8fK7RGHw,5,We had a great meal at a very reasonable price and we left happy.,

ZY6eQLZvWIieMcTuYURYKg,4,"If you are craving a gray salad bar, they're the place for that too!",
ZY6eQLZvWIieMcTuYURYKg,4,BurgerPalace has amazing coupons and daily deals; and we're still trying to figure out how they stay in business when they give food away at crazy prices!,
ZY6eQLZvWIieMcTuYURYKg,4,"Check it out, you won't be disappointed.",
ZY6eQLZvWIieMcTuYURYKg,4,I gave them 4 stars because they closed the stores that were closed nearby!,
PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1,Went there for lunch today and we both ordered the Garden Bar (we have always loved it).,
PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1,It was below sub par.,
PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1,"Most, if not all, of the food on the bar was OLD.",
PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1,"Brown lettuce, dried up cucumbers, dry pasta salad, rubbery spinach and broccoli, squash salad was dry on top from sitting out so long.",
PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1,"I tried to eat some of each thing and it all kept getting worse, so I asked to see the manager.",
PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1,"He was polite, and removed the $11.99 x2 for the salad bars off our bill.",
PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1,"The waitress came over with our revised bill and said ""I looked at the salad bar and everything looked fine to me.""",
PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1,"When I started telling her everything I listed above she rudely interrupted me and said ""wait...I'm leaving"".",
PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1,And walked away.,
PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1,If she didn't want to hear what I had actually experienced from the salad bar then why did she think it was ok to voice her inexperienced opinion?,
PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1,She didn't eat any of it.,
PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1,She had no idea how bad it is/was.,
PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1,,
PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1,So I will not be returning because 1) they served old food and 2) rude wait staff named Autumn.,
PNlX74IV6qw9uubE4z8Eqw,1,If I could I would give zero stars.,
F0YSLv7NiUuNP5pCoOaQ5Q,5,My daughter and I stopped by on a Friday night for a meal.,
F0YSLv7NiUuNP5pCoOaQ5Q,5,The host was kind enough to put us in a socially distanced area.,
F0YSLv7NiUuNP5pCoOaQ5Q,5,NeNe was the waitress that helped us.,

84sU1gBYoROhVwjBphrVZw,3,I finally gave up and ordered a shrimp and pasta dish just to get it done!,
84sU1gBYoROhVwjBphrVZw,3,"It seams that you cannot get a simple order for delivery, but you can order family size meals.",
84sU1gBYoROhVwjBphrVZw,3,I almost did.,

5I23H7Fpx4liJwVMysl9NA,1,Never would have ordered it if I knew that in advance.,
5I23H7Fpx4liJwVMysl9NA,1,The food and portions were average at best and the prices were EXTREMELY high compared to the other BBQ places in the area that serve better food.,
5I23H7Fpx4liJwVMysl9NA,1,I will never be back and by the way a 90% health food grade SUCKS given the fact you get 2 extra point for mgrs. being serve safe certified.,
5I23H7Fpx4liJwVMysl9NA,1,Assuming your mgrs. are certified???,
5I23H7Fpx4liJwVMysl9NA,1,"your real score is an 88% a ""B""!!",
5I23H7Fpx4liJwVMysl9NA,1,Another SCAM!!!,
IhTGFQBUBSNUocgkOzLEMA,1,This sign says staff wear a mask but the people in the back cooking the food do not have masks on and some of the staff are walking around with the mask half or entirely off their face.,
IhTGFQBUBSNUocgkOzLEMA,1,The manager has it hanging half off one ear so it's obviously not enforced.,
IhTGFQBUBSNUocgkOzLEMA,1,If management doesn't take it seriously the why would the staff.,
hnDmMQ9Ov46VrpYwgebR4w,1,Worst place in the area to order food.,
hnDmMQ9Ov46VrpYwgebR4w,1,"I ordered on line and they didn't have an item that was listed, so instead of calling me to change the sides they gave me something I don't eat.",

hnDmMQ9Ov46VrpYwgebR4w,1,,

hnDmMQ9Ov46VrpYwgebR4w,1,He was rude and said if you want your money back you deal with them.,
hnDmMQ9Ov46VrpYwgebR4w,1,I didn't ask about no money.,

jP-492Ni8xz05T9VXDo14Q,3,"The 20-year-old hostess, the very first person you see when you walked through the door, was not wearing a mask at all.",
jP-492Ni8xz05T9VXDo14Q,3,And she said something like she wished everything were back to normal.,
jP-492Ni8xz05T9VXDo14Q,3,The manager was aware of her not wearing a mask but said and did nothing.,
jP-492Ni8xz05T9VXDo14Q,3,"If the resto industry -- and all industries for that matter-- wants to keep functioning, then they should enforce strict rules for both employees and customers to protect people who care enough about their health and others.",
jP-492Ni8xz05T9VXDo14Q,3,You would think they have sense enough to know this so as not to alienate their customers.,
jP-492Ni8xz05T9VXDo14Q,3,I think the government should step in and make this part of every resto's health inspection.,
jP-492Ni8xz05T9VXDo14Q,3,P.S.,
jP-492Ni8xz05T9VXDo14Q,3,Too bad their grilled chicken and chicken & broccoli were not so bad.,
jP-492Ni8xz05T9VXDo14Q,3,And our waitress was fantastic.,
jP-492Ni8xz05T9VXDo14Q,3,But eating in a resto isn't just about food-- it's also about experience.,

cCBErpg1CDuPK2D9Cux2YQ,2,"‚Äç The menu looked fabulous, however the reality was not so fab.",
cCBErpg1CDuPK2D9Cux2YQ,2,Are they actually cooking in the kitchen or reheating pre-prepared meals?,
KKq3n3ZwMEqX94PFaO3kWQ,1,Covid is nothing but a scapegoat for awful service.,
KKq3n3ZwMEqX94PFaO3kWQ,1,This place could give a crap less if I came in and ate or not.,
KKq3n3ZwMEqX94PFaO3kWQ,1,Stood at door for 5 minutes before being acknowledged.,
KKq3n3ZwMEqX94PFaO3kWQ,1,Place was empty.,

5-Y4MjFcWlm6ppxjEELciA,1,I have to say I strongly suggest skipping this restaurant.,
5-Y4MjFcWlm6ppxjEELciA,1,"My wine came in a glass full of lipstick stains from a prior patron, my order took forever and I was incorrectly charged for the wrong, more expensive, chardonnay.",
5-Y4MjFcWlm6ppxjEELciA,1,The salmon on the salad was decent but I guess I expected more than iceberg lettuce.,
5-Y4MjFcWlm6ppxjEELciA,1,My friend's meal was barely edible but she'll be posting her own review.,
NpAs_RZpvGyWbLIdnusW7w,1,Let me say I understand the pandemic has caused a shortage of servers.,
NpAs_RZpvGyWbLIdnusW7w,1,The manager customer service was worse than the new server.,
NpAs_RZpvGyWbLIdnusW7w,1,We waited an hour for our food which were quick pick options.,
NpAs_RZpvGyWbLIdnusW7w,1,They got the order wrong then the portion of the side items was ridiculous.,
NpAs_RZpvGyWbLIdnusW7w,1,They will not get my money ever again.,

egkzTirKcj1wJZtDu_Orzg,1,"Food was good 1 star for that, customer service sucked.",
H6YdxOcrmquIkZS_3ep3VQ,1,The place needs renovation and thorough washing.,
H6YdxOcrmquIkZS_3ep3VQ,1,"We ordered grilled salmon and it was literally cold/frozen inside, so we had to wait for another grilled salmon.",
H6YdxOcrmquIkZS_3ep3VQ,1,Shouldn't they check temperature of the inside of meat or fish if it's cooked?.. Shrimp and scampi pasta was very plain.,
H6YdxOcrmquIkZS_3ep3VQ,1,The only thing was good was smoked burger with fries.,
H6YdxOcrmquIkZS_3ep3VQ,1,Soft drinks took too long to refill.,
H6YdxOcrmquIkZS_3ep3VQ,1,We left disappointed with the experience.,

0d1sEnL3ACHKEXdtAbSbpA,2,I called ahead and confirmed with the bartender that they had kids eat free on tuesdays after 5pm.,
0d1sEnL3ACHKEXdtAbSbpA,2,We had three adult meals and three kids meals .,
0d1sEnL3ACHKEXdtAbSbpA,2,The manager refused to give us the kids eat free discount even though someone on the staff confirmed they were still offering the special .,
w0zbAxQ8yTPXLPaIF1itEA,1,The food was burned and missing chicken from the dish.,

uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.,
uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,"On Mother's Day, I felt that I wanted to at least order my mother and I a steak since we couldn't do what we really want due to the Covid 19 outbreak.",
uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,"Now, before people say give them a break because of this, just know the similar restaurants in the same area are just known to be less than a pleasurable experience.",
uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,I ordered online and my mother actually was picking it up to bring on the way to see me so that we may eat together.,
uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,She called from up there to tell em the curb side was a no go because after 20 minutes of waiting no one came out so she went in.,
uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,The manager was the one who dealt with my mother in saying that the order wasn't ready and didn't know when it would be.,
uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,"She also said the ticket number didn't matter because they were so overwhelmed and ""everyone ordered steak"".",
uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,Not a good look.,
uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,My mother handed her the phone because I called to see if everything was ok.,
uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,The manager basically told me the same thing.,
uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,"If I hadn't paid ahead, of course I would have cancelled.",
uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,I had my mother leave because I didn't want her having to do all that on Mother's Day.,
uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,My husband went back up there and brought the order back almost two hours after it was supposed to be done.,
uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,( I gave them an hour because of Covid and it being Mothers Day).,
uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,The steak was thrown together.,
uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,There was no difference in the well and medium well done steaks and both were missing the salad.,
uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,We did however get the baked potato but that was a no go because they decided to put bacon bits on it when that's not how we ordered it because guess what... you guessed it.,
uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,I don't eat pork .,
uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,This was ridiculous.,
uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,I hope any other companies who decide to open back up during the pandemic is ready.,
uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,"This manager told me that they are open , but not fully staffed.",
uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,"They aren't fully open not ready to serve inside, curb side and to go like they say.",
uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,Plus they had a line out of the door trying to figure out what happened to their online order and curbside orders.,
uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,"They may as well have opened their dining room up to full capacity because the way this was set up, there was literally no room for social distancing if that was their goal.",
uPMBwlzRFVfKQbtfvN20qg,1,Do better Camp Creek BurgerPalace !!!,
WmdhlaNYV6R59mQCi41d2w,3,"Nice dining area, long wait just order food, short staffed, 3-cheese brisket sandwich okay",
WmdhlaNYV6R59mQCi41d2w,3,.,
WmdhlaNYV6R59mQCi41d2w,3,The cheese and Texas toast are good but the bacon-like brisket is too chewy and fatty filled.,
WmdhlaNYV6R59mQCi41d2w,3,The fries are crispy good.,
WmdhlaNYV6R59mQCi41d2w,3,The brisket tacodilla has the same issues as the 3-cheese brisket.,
WmdhlaNYV6R59mQCi41d2w,3,Now the salad bar is a different story.,
WmdhlaNYV6R59mQCi41d2w,3,That's still good & highly recommended.,
EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,The food was just ok to me.,
EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,It did come out very hot so I could tell they just cooked it.,
EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,I think the reason I gave it a 3 star was cause the drinks were very weak.,
EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,So I was a little disappointed.,
EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,I was hoping for a stronger taste but was disappointed.,
EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,The staff was very nIce and accommodating.,
EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,The waiter was also on point.,
EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,He kept checking on us to see if we needed anything.,
EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,"Made sure our food was cooked like we wanted, and just a nice guy overall.",
EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,The salad bar needed to be refreshed.,
EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,I wasn't liking the choices.,
EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,It looked like it had been picked over.,
EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,So even though we got the salad bar I wanted it to have fuller.,
EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,I will say once I started heading towards the door to leave a worker was at the salad bar replenishing the food but I was already leaving.,
EEVTRaj3hmAfrGqYoLgY2w,3,I will come back because all in all it was a positive experience.,
3zsv7rqwdSVaFdCY13y0tQ,1,Jessica has to be the absolute worst waiter I have ever encountered .,

3zsv7rqwdSVaFdCY13y0tQ,1,If I could give negative zero stars I would happily do so.,
3zsv7rqwdSVaFdCY13y0tQ,1,Non attentive staff makes the mediocre at best food 10x worse.,

BElYTFA8Rsxc4qQsRIM4qQ,2,I remember when BurgerPalace was a nice place.,
BElYTFA8Rsxc4qQsRIM4qQ,2,We were disappointed by everything except out waiter.,
ZRqT1p2NYeD0dfK2HEJhGA,1,We have been there three times each time the salad bar has been amazing as for the rest of the food not so great me and my wife both ordered steaks and our 10-year-old daughter ordered the salmon,
ZRqT1p2NYeD0dfK2HEJhGA,1,the food was horrible I believe roadkill would've tasted better should've went to Arby's across the street this is the third time in A six-month period the service was great the food was horrible will not be a fourth time eat at your own risk go to Burger King or McDonald's you will feel better afterwards,
nvlAgo7gE77Hh0LpRbo1Cg,1,This place has gone downhill in the last 6 months.,

qpXK1vh4DIeJjvT4URUGQw,2,My husband and I were very disappointed.,
qpXK1vh4DIeJjvT4URUGQw,2,We were very surprised that the endless salad bar was an additional $5.99.,
qpXK1vh4DIeJjvT4URUGQw,2,In the past you could always get it as a side with your entree.,
qpXK1vh4DIeJjvT4URUGQw,2,However with inflation we were understanding that restaurants have to raise prices.,
qpXK1vh4DIeJjvT4URUGQw,2,But the salad bar was not well stocked and missing several items.,
qpXK1vh4DIeJjvT4URUGQw,2,If we have to pay $5.99 you would think that it would be well maintained.,
qpXK1vh4DIeJjvT4URUGQw,2,"We did not have a problem with our service, but overall the restaurant was dirty.",
qpXK1vh4DIeJjvT4URUGQw,2,We will not be returning.,

UH9rvwG1m2csOW9UKBN1Og,2,We had had some issues before trying to order the emailed specials for the day using the app.,
UH9rvwG1m2csOW9UKBN1Og,2,Essentially they won't let you order what they emailed you ...you have to call it in.,
UH9rvwG1m2csOW9UKBN1Og,2,Ok.,
UH9rvwG1m2csOW9UKBN1Og,2,I call it in and I made the dinners the same just to be easier.,
UH9rvwG1m2csOW9UKBN1Og,2,The special was 10.99 for 6 oz steak dinner and 11.99 for 6 oz ribeye.,
UH9rvwG1m2csOW9UKBN1Og,2,(we are seniors so 6oz is ok).,
UH9rvwG1m2csOW9UKBN1Og,2,He shows up to pick up the order and instead of 2x 6 oz steaks we have 2 full size and full priced steaks.,
UH9rvwG1m2csOW9UKBN1Og,2,He gives up and just takes it because waiting another 30-45 minutes was worse.,
UH9rvwG1m2csOW9UKBN1Og,2,He brings the food home and it's also not cooked correctly.,
UH9rvwG1m2csOW9UKBN1Og,2,So the 25.00 special was 50.00 and not at all what we wanted.,
UH9rvwG1m2csOW9UKBN1Og,2,I have finally given up on Ruby!!,

zJodjaUHGzV29pvpZ36vEA,2,The waiter took very poor care of us she only checked in on us one time I find that completely unacceptable our food was messed up and half of us didn't even get the right order it was horrible the burger was soggy and the fries were not done well I am completely and utterly disappointed this is not OK I will not be going back to Alabama to try a BurgerPalace burger ever again unacceptable!!!!!the only good thing there was my root beer!!!!,
QXkJVi4QFJSJ7iFJdIliqw,1,Disgusting.,
QXkJVi4QFJSJ7iFJdIliqw,1,About 5 of us ordered a burger medium - well done and they were PINK.,
QXkJVi4QFJSJ7iFJdIliqw,1,"All of us felt sick as well as the one who got the Mac and cheese, that one puked.",
QXkJVi4QFJSJ7iFJdIliqw,1,Took 2 hours for no reason and we were served last after people who got there after us.,
QXkJVi4QFJSJ7iFJdIliqw,1,We had to walk up to pay as it took well over 10 minutes to grab the card reader because we were so over it.,

aL1T6ehjf5RZkJsF8uiBfQ,1,At least their servers are friendly and check in on you.,
aL1T6ehjf5RZkJsF8uiBfQ,1,This is ridiculous.,
aL1T6ehjf5RZkJsF8uiBfQ,1,Sat for an hour while the server walked circles around us.,
aL1T6ehjf5RZkJsF8uiBfQ,1,She never once asked how the good was outdated when the food would be out.,
aL1T6ehjf5RZkJsF8uiBfQ,1,She obviously does like her job or know what she is doing,
aL1T6ehjf5RZkJsF8uiBfQ,1,.,
aL1T6ehjf5RZkJsF8uiBfQ,1,Only talked to us when we placed our order.,

FX3wHLDSmjSdct3wXU2t-A,2,You will find a scant all-you-can-eat salad bar for 12 plus dollars.,
FX3wHLDSmjSdct3wXU2t-A,2,"You will not find pasta, chips, salsa, soup, or much of anything.",
FX3wHLDSmjSdct3wXU2t-A,2,The coconut shrimp was fair but expensive and a fairly small portion.,

FX3wHLDSmjSdct3wXU2t-A,2,I would avoid this restaurant for the foreseeable future.,
prMdrZHMVJLJork-NjZSXw,1,We were on the road heading to Arizona.,
prMdrZHMVJLJork-NjZSXw,1,We stopped at the BurgerPalace for lunch.,
prMdrZHMVJLJork-NjZSXw,1,We ordered our meal to go to eat it in the RV.,
prMdrZHMVJLJork-NjZSXw,1,The Backyard BBQ salad was nothing but burnt chicken (no BBQ sauce) and lettuce.,
prMdrZHMVJLJork-NjZSXw,1,"It was missing all of the other ingredients, including the dressing.",
prMdrZHMVJLJork-NjZSXw,1,Returned it for a new one.,
prMdrZHMVJLJork-NjZSXw,1,This time it had all the ingredients but very little lettuce.,
prMdrZHMVJLJork-NjZSXw,1,"The BBQ sauce was drenched on the salad, and it had the same burnt chicken as I took a bite out of the one I returned.",
prMdrZHMVJLJork-NjZSXw,1,There was the piece I ate.,
prMdrZHMVJLJork-NjZSXw,1,The restaurant was empty so there was no reason for this type of service.,
prMdrZHMVJLJork-NjZSXw,1,Definitely not worth the $14.00.,
SyDcfeC_X9UNG7OW_fNs_Q,2,My son and I got the smothered bbq sirloin.,
SyDcfeC_X9UNG7OW_fNs_Q,2,The sirloin was tough as leather!,

SyDcfeC_X9UNG7OW_fNs_Q,2,Service was good.,
SyDcfeC_X9UNG7OW_fNs_Q,2,It's pretty bad when the broccoli was the best thing on the plate!,
Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,Oh gee --- I tried to really think about how I could rate this experience better than 1..,
Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,The server was a 4 as she was trying her best.... but if this is how this place is managed... will never go to another BurgerPalace again.,
Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,Went to BurgerPalace across the street from our hotel.,
Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,,
Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,Tried to go to a Mexican restaurant which is normal for us when out of town --- but it was Cinco De Mayo so ---- all forget going to a Mexican restaurant unless you want to wait for an hour and ... well... never mind.,
Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,The parking lot was nearly empty so thought a good choice....,
Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,WRONG!!!,
Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,Only two servers and one bartender.,
Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,Most of the tables were empty because no one was working.,
Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,"Hostess was sweet, kind, and very nice!!",
Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,,
Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,Told us it would be about a 25 minute wait so ... we did.,
Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,Once we were seated we decided to share a few Mexican appetizers since Mexican food is one of our favorites and the salad bar looked less than appealing --- which was the original plan.,
Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,"Ordered two appetizers -- one was the nachos and didn't want the bbq sauce (yes, on chicken nachos) so asked if we could get salsa.",
Vsc5Lxi2L_q0tnWoysGUOg,1,The server was very accommodating...,

NpsWODc82pt74zCIg6Knmw,3,So here's my opinion and it is just that.,
NpsWODc82pt74zCIg6Knmw,3,Ruby's is always a hit or miss.,
NpsWODc82pt74zCIg6Knmw,3,I never go in expecting great food or service.,
NpsWODc82pt74zCIg6Knmw,3,I am never surprised when things aren't tasty and I have never been surprised with amazing food either.,
NpsWODc82pt74zCIg6Knmw,3,Generally the staff is friendly.,
NpsWODc82pt74zCIg6Knmw,3,It is a decent place to take a family,

l57DFQwHSB2I8F_Q3YgxrQ,2,"I'll just say that it fell below my expectations, and even then, they weren't that high.",
l57DFQwHSB2I8F_Q3YgxrQ,2,"It's understaffed (at least when I visited) which leads to an overworked waiter/waitress, which then leads to mistakes.",
l57DFQwHSB2I8F_Q3YgxrQ,2,"My wife's order was incorrect, my burger came out thirty minutes ahead of her meal, and it took an additional 10 minutes to be given the ketchup I had asked for.",
l57DFQwHSB2I8F_Q3YgxrQ,2,"I really dislike giving bad reviews, I try to look at the best in everything, but without saying a word to each other during the lunch due the awkward nature of the environment, the first thing my wife and I said to each other (as if it were rehearsed) is, ""We're not coming here again.",

dINmk0-eRjGodK8J3KNukA,4,Shrimps were kinda small so I would've just ordered a full rack instead of half rack of ribs.,

j_SCimK6XrNuCbRubd8Gvg,1,As we moved on to ordering our food he continued to get the order wrong as we placed it.,
j_SCimK6XrNuCbRubd8Gvg,1,I looked at my wife and told her be ready because our food is coming out wrong.,
j_SCimK6XrNuCbRubd8Gvg,1,Sure enough 1 hour later our food comes out and my burger is beyond under cooked.,
j_SCimK6XrNuCbRubd8Gvg,1,My wife's steak is so tuff that she couldn't even chew it.,

j_SCimK6XrNuCbRubd8Gvg,1,All the waiter said to us was we can order something new ?!,
j_SCimK6XrNuCbRubd8Gvg,1,Why do you can bring that order out wrong as well.,
j_SCimK6XrNuCbRubd8Gvg,1,My advice is that management have waiters write people's order down and not try to remember them the odject is to work smarter not harder.,

uIll5COivZaSLuaWWaCODg,1,Ordered the food to go.,
uIll5COivZaSLuaWWaCODg,1,It was cold and disgusting.,
uIll5COivZaSLuaWWaCODg,1,Everything was sticky and the hamburger was like 3/4 of a patty.,
uIll5COivZaSLuaWWaCODg,1,Chips were stale and small amount of dip for the price.,
uIll5COivZaSLuaWWaCODg,1,shrimp were overcooked.,
uIll5COivZaSLuaWWaCODg,1,Will not order from again.,
PysUqQnPZBjUdmZhKZujGg,1,Extremely disappointed.,
PysUqQnPZBjUdmZhKZujGg,1,First started with no salad bar due to lack of employees.,
PysUqQnPZBjUdmZhKZujGg,1,Yet there are multiple employees standing around with nothing to do.,
PysUqQnPZBjUdmZhKZujGg,1,"Second fault was bit into my chicken corn chowder and cold as can be, thus your soup is not fresh.",
PysUqQnPZBjUdmZhKZujGg,1,Simply microwaved from fridge.,
PysUqQnPZBjUdmZhKZujGg,1,Third strike to one star rating ordered salmon and 1/3 of it was raw.,
PysUqQnPZBjUdmZhKZujGg,1,Urge you to go elsewhere.,
PysUqQnPZBjUdmZhKZujGg,1,No offer by server to comp anything knowing the failure to deliver quality food.,
_5tkLBQl_D4sJuSMmAejFg,1,The restaurant was absolutely filthy.,
_5tkLBQl_D4sJuSMmAejFg,1,The hostess quickly put on a mask when she saw me wearing mine.,
_5tkLBQl_D4sJuSMmAejFg,1,She literally seated us at a dirty table.,
_5tkLBQl_D4sJuSMmAejFg,1,I asked for a different one.,
_5tkLBQl_D4sJuSMmAejFg,1,They would only seat in the dirty section.,
_5tkLBQl_D4sJuSMmAejFg,1,There was a clean section but they would not seat anyone there because it had been cleaned for the night.,
_5tkLBQl_D4sJuSMmAejFg,1,"The floor was covered in food, it did not smell clean at all and the food was sub par.",
_5tkLBQl_D4sJuSMmAejFg,1,I would have left but my husband was hungry and no other late night options.,
_5tkLBQl_D4sJuSMmAejFg,1,The waitress was very sweet and helpful so she got a nice tip.,
_5tkLBQl_D4sJuSMmAejFg,1,It wasn't her fault.,
_5tkLBQl_D4sJuSMmAejFg,1,We will not eat there again.,
m3jzariHFSWcECxjuPa_Aw,2,I wanted to give this 3 stars.,
m3jzariHFSWcECxjuPa_Aw,2,I thought the waitress was both friendly and attentive.,
m3jzariHFSWcECxjuPa_Aw,2,Even with the tail end of COVID still lingering the salad bar was up and running which is a plus.,
m3jzariHFSWcECxjuPa_Aw,2,I know it's my fault for ordering ribs from here.,
m3jzariHFSWcECxjuPa_Aw,2,I know that RT is not an award winning bbq establishment.,
m3jzariHFSWcECxjuPa_Aw,2,It was late and I wanted to keep rolling so this is where I stopped.,
m3jzariHFSWcECxjuPa_Aw,2,The ribs arrived with minimal sauce.,
m3jzariHFSWcECxjuPa_Aw,2,I had to ask for more.,
m3jzariHFSWcECxjuPa_Aw,2,"But even though they were fall-off-the-bone, they were DRY.",
m3jzariHFSWcECxjuPa_Aw,2,Probably would have been happier had I just ordered the salad bar.,
6Tuyrt2oHaU0n7NCbaQaZQ,4,Best salad bar in town.,
6Tuyrt2oHaU0n7NCbaQaZQ,4,"Service varies - sometimes lacking, sometimes great...dishes are pretty good but love that salad bar!!!",
4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,Was looking forward to a good hot meal after a long day of travel.,
4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,Sat at the bar which was my first mistake.,
4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,Basically a hang out area for all the employees who do not have customers help.,
4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,It was very loud with all of their work chatter.,
4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,The drink was good.,
4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,"I ordered the 12oz ribeye, asked for it medium well.",
4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,When it arrived it looked a bit funky.,
4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,I questioned if it was beef.,
4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,It looked like a pork chop.,
4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,When I cut into it it was very bloody.,
4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,"Now the blood is in my potatoes and corn, couldn't stomach that.",
4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,"Asked to have it cooked longer, twice.",
4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,"When it was returned to me it was not replated, served on a small salad plate.",
4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,Needless to say it wasn't good.,
4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,And I'm still pretty sure it wasn't beef.,
4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,Just not good food or experience.,
4ZWcepZ2E_ddcm4aAzau2g,2,Stick with the salad bar.,
aBcnhUftabS-5ptRw0LC7g,5,Had a new chef training and our server Alison was so attentive.,
aBcnhUftabS-5ptRw0LC7g,5,she caught on right away that something was wrong and returned with a new burger that was cooked just right.,
aBcnhUftabS-5ptRw0LC7g,5,she was at our table frequently and the service was GREAT.,
aBcnhUftabS-5ptRw0LC7g,5,WONDERFUL SERVER.,
W_2IAY9chhUGPgd8X7rrRA,2,Waited 30 minutes for burgers burnt beyond recognition.,
W_2IAY9chhUGPgd8X7rrRA,2,This was my last time at BurgerPalace,
Yxxgf_bT76Bi_Vuf4iZUpA,1,1 star is generous.,
Yxxgf_bT76Bi_Vuf4iZUpA,1,Worst restaurant experience I have ever had.,
Yxxgf_bT76Bi_Vuf4iZUpA,1,"Salad bar food was worse than old, it was rotten, spoiled, disgusting.",
Yxxgf_bT76Bi_Vuf4iZUpA,1,"We were told they were changing out the lettuce, they did, with more rotten lettuce.",
Yxxgf_bT76Bi_Vuf4iZUpA,1,The beets were so bad I spit them out.,
Yxxgf_bT76Bi_Vuf4iZUpA,1,"The waitress brought my husband's food out and I explained the salad bar was bad, and that I actually had to spit food out.",
Yxxgf_bT76Bi_Vuf4iZUpA,1,"She said ""oh really"" and walked off, never to be seen again.",
Yxxgf_bT76Bi_Vuf4iZUpA,1,My husband's sliders were pucks of something.,
Yxxgf_bT76Bi_Vuf4iZUpA,1,"Thankfully we got Brian, the best thing about this place, who brought the manager.",
Yxxgf_bT76Bi_Vuf4iZUpA,1,"Obviously we told her what happened she offered new food, yeah no.",
Yxxgf_bT76Bi_Vuf4iZUpA,1,If you are going to this restaurant for any other reason than to speak to Brian I would rethink.,
9f5yaymNnIz4PvsDP6IoBA,1,Absolutely do not come if you need service.,
9f5yaymNnIz4PvsDP6IoBA,1,We got salad bar and water(one glass).,
9f5yaymNnIz4PvsDP6IoBA,1,"No ticket, no service.",
9f5yaymNnIz4PvsDP6IoBA,1,The doors will close soon.,
Q3p4yHeXLs7hznVbJy5_xA,1,The salad bar was good!!,
Q3p4yHeXLs7hznVbJy5_xA,1,"Now, the rest of the story....",
Q3p4yHeXLs7hznVbJy5_xA,1,I don't know where to begin with this travesty of service we experienced.,
Q3p4yHeXLs7hznVbJy5_xA,1,I'm still astonished at the sheer indifference to the BASIC customer related skills.,
Q3p4yHeXLs7hznVbJy5_xA,1,We received a NOTICEABLY dirty highchair which I cleaned with paper towels from the bathroom and my alcohol solution; we did the same with the table since it was sticky; no napkins offered with the meals so back to the brown napkins AGAIN; I received cutlery because I ordered the salad bar...no one else at the table did because she decided that they didn't need any.,
Q3p4yHeXLs7hznVbJy5_xA,1,I'm BEYOND BELIEF at the WORST EXPERIENCE we've had in decades.,
Q3p4yHeXLs7hznVbJy5_xA,1,What happened to the BurgerPalace franchise?,
Q3p4yHeXLs7hznVbJy5_xA,1,Read my review and heed my warning.,
oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2,I haven't been here since before the COVID 19 shut down.,
oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2,So it has been a good 15 months or more.,
oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2,"Now, I know the pandemic was brutally on restaurants, but this restaurant managed to survive.",
oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2,Warning they are short help.,
oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2,Upon walking in the bar has a massive table filled with to go bags.,
oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2,Delivery and pick up.,
oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2,The employee guarding the food acknowledge me and that was it.,
oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2,Asked for a table and received a blank stare.,
oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2,I waited a few minutes until a women appeared and asked how many.,
oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2,She seats me in a both with a terrible chirping sound going off above.,
oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2,,
oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2,"So kind of alarm or warning sound, so now I am thinking what is going on here. Dinners are in their booths carrying on no one notices this sound. Waitress comes over and says, "" I am moving you down, so you do not have to hear the alarm while you dine."" Apparently, service had not arrived and they were working and seating dinners while this alarm was chirping all day.",
oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2,"Carpet in the dining section I was in was worn and the rubber backing was showing and sticking to the souls of my sandals. They still over the salad bar, but there were no takers.",
oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2,Wise decision.,
oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2,Pandemic is not over.,
oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2,ONE waitress for the entire waitress.,
oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2,This women was doing a great job.,
oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2,"She was attentive, and making sure she made up for the day's situation.",
oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2,"Cook was slow, or did not have help, because it took awhile for the triple prime cheese burger and fries to arrive.",
oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2,But it was hot.,
oLJ2cWsepmjcp3BW3ec2Ng,2,"If you are going to this location, have some patience's as the restaurant is under staffed and so of the employees are dedicated to good service.",
mXYOOHe3VXS5Jfd7iu5v-g,1,Took a long time to get a cheeseburger only to get a cold hamburger and fries.,
mXYOOHe3VXS5Jfd7iu5v-g,1,Then the waitress had an attitude about my daughters cheeseburger not having pickles.,
mXYOOHe3VXS5Jfd7iu5v-g,1,Then the manager came over to try to smooth things over by asking if she could fix it by making another one.,
mXYOOHe3VXS5Jfd7iu5v-g,1,Hell no I'm not waiting another 1/2 hour for another cold cheeseburger.,
OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,Very disappointed.,
OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,"Went on easter sunday, they did not have enough help to have us to be able to eat dinner.",
OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,I was like ok.,
OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,We left.,
OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,"Came back on Monday me and my kids, was seated quickly.",
OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,Ordered food and drinks took a very long time to get our food.,
OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,My son's cheeseburger had no cheese!,
OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,"So I waited on waiter to let him know, he said he picked up wrong burger.",
OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,Took over 30 minutes to bring a piece of cold cheese on the plate.,
OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,Why not have them re make the burger so cheese could have been melted.,
OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,Noticed that the table close to me the waiter kept forgetting their food orders and adding things they told them to leave off.,
OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,Well this doesn't bit the apple.,
OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,I ordered zucchini it was so greasy I could use it to fry chicken.,
OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,I ordered ribs they were cooked to hard couldn't cut it with the knife.,
OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,So I let waiter know he sent manager out she replaced both well when it came back out looked as if someone ate the meat off of the rib it was just bones.,
OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,I just threw it in trash when I left.,
OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,Waiters fingers were in my fries as he carried my plate.,
OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,I used to love eating dinner at this place everyday.,
OjOtyqOU5IDpVIRezmoUNQ,1,Now this experience has definitely turned my yes into a definitely no.,
YbkH_YiLRmJPV5mbaXndvg,1,"If you plan on going to get curbside pickup, forget it.",
YbkH_YiLRmJPV5mbaXndvg,1,You can call the number on the sign and the phone will ring until you hear the voice mail pick up and then hang up.,
YbkH_YiLRmJPV5mbaXndvg,1,So I thought they must be busy so I go inside and when I did the staff was just standing around.,
YbkH_YiLRmJPV5mbaXndvg,1,The girl at the door didn't even acknowledge me.,
YbkH_YiLRmJPV5mbaXndvg,1,"So if I could give ""0"" stars for device I would.",
YbkH_YiLRmJPV5mbaXndvg,1,Get the food home and it was burnt and tasteless.,
YbkH_YiLRmJPV5mbaXndvg,1,This is one of the worst restaurants and staff in Florence.,
YbkH_YiLRmJPV5mbaXndvg,1,Avoid at all costs.,
I84GXC7nL0jnQ03AbvIpaw,1,We had a party of five and all of our orders were mixed up on each individuals plate.,
I84GXC7nL0jnQ03AbvIpaw,1,One of our buddies asked for Mayo for his burger and received tarter sauce.,
I84GXC7nL0jnQ03AbvIpaw,1,"They did take the burger off for the inconvenience, but we all had loaded fries with cheese and the cheese was not melted.",
I84GXC7nL0jnQ03AbvIpaw,1,"Another individual in our party received a loaded baked potato with only sour cream on it, no bacon or cheese so It wasn't even loaded.",
I84GXC7nL0jnQ03AbvIpaw,1,All in all we will not be going back to this restaurant.,

#NAME?,1,Most tables were empty and a majority of the empty tables were dirty.,
#NAME?,1,The floor was covered with pieces of food.,
#NAME?,1,We were seated in a booth that appeared to have been wiped off with a dirty rag.,
#NAME?,1,It was 10-15 minutes before any wait staff asked us for our drink order.,
#NAME?,1,"Once we ordered, I opened my napkin/silverware and the utensils were very dirty with caked on filth.",
#NAME?,1,My husband's silverware was even more dirty.,
#NAME?,1,That was all we could take.,
#NAME?,1,We cancelled our order and left.,
#NAME?,1,It was gross!,
pPp_oSqGJgft83s14ePoyg,1,Our sampler was delicious.,
pPp_oSqGJgft83s14ePoyg,1,Mine and my husband's chicken BBQ salad was terrible . Lettuce should be in the trash.,
pPp_oSqGJgft83s14ePoyg,1,Our waiter Ryan was amazing.,
pL3_Q6vrrlwQWfR5Ph9vfw,1,Awful.,
pL3_Q6vrrlwQWfR5Ph9vfw,1,We arrived to the restaurant and were seated immediately.,
pL3_Q6vrrlwQWfR5Ph9vfw,1,We were the first to sit down.,
pL3_Q6vrrlwQWfR5Ph9vfw,1,"Our appetizer was delivered to the wrong table, and we had to wait 15 minutes for a refill.",

ZUdMCF80STqaJ_guDTqWkg,1,I wouldn't feed the food to a dog!,
ZUdMCF80STqaJ_guDTqWkg,1,Do not order the ribeye steak!,
ZUdMCF80STqaJ_guDTqWkg,1,"Tough, fatty, gross.",
ZUdMCF80STqaJ_guDTqWkg,1,The food itself has zero flavor and was drowning in grease!,
ZUdMCF80STqaJ_guDTqWkg,1,I went to a BurgerPalace several years ago and it was good.,
ZUdMCF80STqaJ_guDTqWkg,1,This place should just close their doors awful!,
QrHeXp9c9VaokZmdaFsTIA,5,Most restaurants offer nothing more than a side salad and a Caesar salad or a wilted piece of lettuce on your burger.,
QrHeXp9c9VaokZmdaFsTIA,5,RT gives you a large salad bar that allows you to select the veggies you enjoy.,
QrHeXp9c9VaokZmdaFsTIA,5,No other chain restaurant other than the buffet joints offer that and the buffet joints can't match the the freshness and quality of the RT offerings.,
QrHeXp9c9VaokZmdaFsTIA,5,"Their service is great, restrooms are very clean, french fries are delicious.",
QrHeXp9c9VaokZmdaFsTIA,5,"All in all, a nice change from the usual chain restaurants.",
UUwztUTcNrB0lDkCsTCOtg,5,"Even though there were only 2 servers on a Friday night, we sat in the bar and Zach was amazing.",
UUwztUTcNrB0lDkCsTCOtg,5,"Food tasted good, service was fast and efficient.",
viVE1oxOQJQwQsPRLK2qSA,1,We sat at our table for 25 minutes and no one even took our drink order.,
viVE1oxOQJQwQsPRLK2qSA,1,There were two more groups and both of them were dissatisfied.,
viVE1oxOQJQwQsPRLK2qSA,1,"One group said they have been waiting for there food for a hour and didn't get anything, and another group they denied service to, They weren't even busy, AT ALL!",
viVE1oxOQJQwQsPRLK2qSA,1,It was ridiculous.,
viVE1oxOQJQwQsPRLK2qSA,1,If I could give them 0 stars I would.,
rRhJdrfkPvaGrktSIWvEeg,1,Don't waste your time here.,
rRhJdrfkPvaGrktSIWvEeg,1,The bartender was the only one waiting on tables at 6pm.,
rRhJdrfkPvaGrktSIWvEeg,1,The chicken strips were the size of a quarter and the mashed potatoes taste like instant mashed potatoes made in a microwave,
8Fox1HBunn-CMfnBVp0-jA,5,"Festus gem for great food, service & friendly staff!",
8Fox1HBunn-CMfnBVp0-jA,5,Salad bar was bountiful and fresh!,
8Fox1HBunn-CMfnBVp0-jA,5,"Enjoyed the salmon, it was flavorful and cooked to glistening perfection.",
8Fox1HBunn-CMfnBVp0-jA,5,Restaurant manager Jane Vogt greeted & seated every customer!,
8Fox1HBunn-CMfnBVp0-jA,5,Exceptionally clean and the atmosphere is well suited for anyone who wishes to enjoy a meal out.,
8Fox1HBunn-CMfnBVp0-jA,5,Carry out also available so you can't go wrong either way.,
8Fox1HBunn-CMfnBVp0-jA,5,I will certainly be back!,
ivwgIb4rnAsCx_Id2coF5w,2,"Website says opened at 11am... doors locked, lights off....",
ivwgIb4rnAsCx_Id2coF5w,2,But the salad bar was stocked.,
ivwgIb4rnAsCx_Id2coF5w,2,Really annoying since it was raining pretty hard and we got soaked for nothing.,
aopmjS9Oa_oWTT_DwWMQoQ,3,My husband and I went for the 2 for 1 fajitas.,
aopmjS9Oa_oWTT_DwWMQoQ,3,Little did we know they were going to take one order of fajitas and turn it in to two.,
aopmjS9Oa_oWTT_DwWMQoQ,3,Our plates looked NOTHING like the picture in the add.,
aopmjS9Oa_oWTT_DwWMQoQ,3,"When I questioned management her answer was ""we just serve what they send us.""",
aopmjS9Oa_oWTT_DwWMQoQ,3,"Notice the cheese, sour cream and lettuce in the add?",

aopmjS9Oa_oWTT_DwWMQoQ,3,Very disappointing.,
G7RNy1Eipfax9qtbnYu7ig,1,Don't bother wasting your time at their Festus location.,
G7RNy1Eipfax9qtbnYu7ig,1,We went and they had one server for the whole restaurant as well as being the bartender.,
G7RNy1Eipfax9qtbnYu7ig,1,They had a party of 11 and told us there would be a long wait and told another lady 25 minutes.,
G7RNy1Eipfax9qtbnYu7ig,1,You could not possibly get waited on in time if you only had a limited lunch break for work.,
G7RNy1Eipfax9qtbnYu7ig,1,Last time we went all we wanted was the salad bar and they told us it would be a long wait.,
G7RNy1Eipfax9qtbnYu7ig,1,It's no wonder BurgerPalace is closing locations.,
G7RNy1Eipfax9qtbnYu7ig,1,Terrible customer service.,
Ud32RLiaOXRpG1Fc1_9pgw,1,Just a terrible place to eat.,
Ud32RLiaOXRpG1Fc1_9pgw,1,"Use to be very nice the salad bar was empty,I had to get our silverware from the bar, no refills, waited over a hour for a hamburger and tater tots "" the waiter ask if we got our food yet""",
Ud32RLiaOXRpG1Fc1_9pgw,1,"I said no he came back and said "" Oh it's ready in back I don't know why it's not out here I said so it's cold oh no it's been sitting under a heat lamp I said so its dried out.",
Ud32RLiaOXRpG1Fc1_9pgw,1,Got it and the bun was hard and the meat was raw never eat here again,
30v3-6IAdObcIpYrqgyvhQ,1,If I could give zero stars I would.,
30v3-6IAdObcIpYrqgyvhQ,1,,
30v3-6IAdObcIpYrqgyvhQ,1,Stood there for 10 minutes waiting to be seated.,
30v3-6IAdObcIpYrqgyvhQ,1,Someone walked past us and didn't even acknowledge us and never came back.,
30v3-6IAdObcIpYrqgyvhQ,1,"Finally, we and 4 other groups left.",
nXG84TetMCmx8Tk_FlLUvQ,2,This must be a place to go in person because I ordered to go and it was not good!!,
nXG84TetMCmx8Tk_FlLUvQ,2,Shrimp Parmesan pasta was like eating oil and tasteless and a lot smaller portion than you would get in store the amount didn't even cover the to go container bottom and it wasn't a large container.,
nXG84TetMCmx8Tk_FlLUvQ,2,My steak was very over cooked and potato had a weird after taste.,
nXG84TetMCmx8Tk_FlLUvQ,2,For a 100.00 meal it was pretty bad.,
nXG84TetMCmx8Tk_FlLUvQ,2,Not sure how they are still in business closing at 8pm and serving food of this quality.,
nXG84TetMCmx8Tk_FlLUvQ,2,Sorry BurgerPalace I feel like your days are numbered before your out of business.,
9BZB3w9i0V-Ij4THBnZM3w,5,best place ever super yummy salad bar and food great service and friendly staff i will always return thanks ruby tuesday you are awesome,
b7z8pPE6OvIEL7vyVEpoTw,5,"Husband was in the mood for pasta, but in Saraland, there's a serious lack of options for pasta.",
b7z8pPE6OvIEL7vyVEpoTw,5,Then I remembered BurgerPalace so here we are.,
b7z8pPE6OvIEL7vyVEpoTw,5,Staff are all wearing masks.,

V3yePQOssQl2s0ghH-Ld2w,4,BurgerPalace is always a safe go to.,
V3yePQOssQl2s0ghH-Ld2w,4,I'm a big fan of the salad bar but I wish they would bring back the cottage cheese.,
V3yePQOssQl2s0ghH-Ld2w,4,For lunch I usually stick with the salad bar and broccoli and cheese soup.,
V3yePQOssQl2s0ghH-Ld2w,4,It never disappoints.,

6lnHRURh73cTaBbQ5EOVdw,1,Every time they bought something to the table I told the waiter Thank you.,
6lnHRURh73cTaBbQ5EOVdw,1,Had a Bacon Cheese Burger with no Bacon after mentioning it to waiter they responded they didn't have any slices of Bacon so they put Bacon Chips very very sparsely at that.,
6lnHRURh73cTaBbQ5EOVdw,1,So we had them take it off the Bill.,
6lnHRURh73cTaBbQ5EOVdw,1,Tipped usual 20% still no Thank you for coming or come see us again soon.,

Kz5x6A2uvz143aaZoJvGHA,1,THEN when you leave this review: Saucy chicken sandwich had no sauce.,

Kz5x6A2uvz143aaZoJvGHA,1,"How about instead of putting out bad food under a fictitious name (might want to change your photos up by the way, since they're the same on your current menu and all), you might want to own up for your actions and do better.",

atICMujnUDlNVkLwZUmE9g,2,I'm still amazed that this place is still open.,
atICMujnUDlNVkLwZUmE9g,2,Had lunch there a few days ago and the food although descent was WAY over priced.,
atICMujnUDlNVkLwZUmE9g,2,"The appearance of the restaurant was the same as 20 years ago, but back then there were patrons.",
atICMujnUDlNVkLwZUmE9g,2,"On this last visit i only saw half dozen people there, and it should have been packed with the lunch crowd as we're all the others in town.",

r-9Z-3bnPK1pxiR6LTHrQA,4,Little did I know that BurgerPalace next door has their own Untappd Badge.,
r-9Z-3bnPK1pxiR6LTHrQA,4,I am not aware of any other BurgerPalace's that have one.,
r-9Z-3bnPK1pxiR6LTHrQA,4,They also have an Untappd Board to boot.,

kbjaNUs6Ra1ASc7OR7FyFQ,5,"Spent 4hrs on the Highway today and settled into our hotel, and then we took a walk over to the BurgerPalace",
kbjaNUs6Ra1ASc7OR7FyFQ,5,I can't explain how attentive the staff was and how great their courtesies were; it was that good.,
kbjaNUs6Ra1ASc7OR7FyFQ,5,This is probably one of the best places I've been to in a long while that had it all together from all angles.,
kbjaNUs6Ra1ASc7OR7FyFQ,5,Everything was clean/immaculate and the food was delicious.,
kbjaNUs6Ra1ASc7OR7FyFQ,5,They did such a great job.,

Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,"Haven't been here in a long time, but decided to go because of the great salad bar.",
Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,We weren't disappointed in that aspect.,
Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,It has been remodeled and is a very nice place.,
Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,I was with my friend who was in town for dialysis and she can't eat a lot of things so ordered a plain burger well done.,
Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,My mother ordered a fancy burger medium well.,
Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,When they came my friends was pink in the middle and my moms was rare.,
Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,My friend sent hers back.,
Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,She has been a cook for years and so I asked her what the plan was in a situation like this.,
Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,She said you make them a new burger.,
Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,After 10 minutes her burger came back on a very hot plate.,
Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,We looked at each other and knew exactly what happened.,
Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,The cook nuked it.,
Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,And what proof do we have?,
Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,Her bun was rock hard.,
Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,"Add into this the waitress looked like she'd just been flogged in the kitchen-bawling face, tears, etc. so not sure what happened back there but it wasn't her fault.",
Pz72qqpVhgu3j9x8mUlQRw,3,So not very happy with this visit.,

ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,I ordered online and picked up food to go.,
ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,"I had a gift card, so consequently I went inside to purchase my food.",
ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,"The restaurant has remodeled within the past year, and the place looks AMAZING!",
ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,"When I entered, the hostess told me I should go to the bar to get my takeout order.",
ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,"The bartender was friendly, pleasant, polite, just exceptional.",
ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,I have to take a minute & stop to tell you about the actual BurgerPalace restaurant building itself.,
ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,(Granted I didn't see the ENTIRE inside--but enough) Totally Beautiful!,
ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,The atmosphere and ambience was so cool--sort of a 'warm-fun-classic-happy style' I would call it.,
ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,If there is such a thing.,
ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,The lighting was great...,
ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,And who notices & comments on a restaurants lighting?,
ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,(Not me usually) but I still can't believe how awesome it was to walk into that place.,
ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,Some thing about it was warm and inviting and welcoming.,
ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,When I got home and had the food--even better.,
ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,I had steak and a baked potato...,
ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,And it was to die for.,
ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,I haven't had BurgerPalace in a long time and I am definitely going to change that-because obviously they have changed some things--- and the changes have been good!,
ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,,
ckb_y2Z6IDbmEfQ29wXyDg,5,Try it for yourself.,
p0PNhev5xROil_tJEDs-9Q,4,I'm not normally a fan of chain restaurants.,
p0PNhev5xROil_tJEDs-9Q,4,They often disappoint.,
p0PNhev5xROil_tJEDs-9Q,4,"However, I'm going to give this BurgerPalace a 4 because, not only was my fish well cooked and actually flavorful, but they had an open salad bar.",
p0PNhev5xROil_tJEDs-9Q,4,"You may think this isn't a huge feat, especially for a BurgerPalace, but during COVID, this was a very welcome surprise.",
p0PNhev5xROil_tJEDs-9Q,4,"Before anyone gets cross eyed and offended that they would have a salad bar open during this time, they took several precautions to maintain, at least what I consider, an adequate level of safety.",
p0PNhev5xROil_tJEDs-9Q,4,I give them kudos for making that amenity available.,
p0PNhev5xROil_tJEDs-9Q,4,Especially since we were a family of weary travelers that had been in the road for a few days and this hit the spot,

ZoXFHor_ALyVtr9lf-hXWQ,1,Went to try the brunch today.,
ZoXFHor_ALyVtr9lf-hXWQ,1,It was mediocre at best - salad bar is always pretty good.,
ZoXFHor_ALyVtr9lf-hXWQ,1,The part that really disappointed me is when I had an omelette made to order and I got about a quarter of the way through it and found a short black hair stuck in it.,
ZoXFHor_ALyVtr9lf-hXWQ,1,"When I brought it to the waitress's attention she just said, ""ewe, that's gross."" Nothing else was done for us, not even a manager sent over to apologize.",
ZoXFHor_ALyVtr9lf-hXWQ,1,Just paid the bill and left knowing we won't go back.,
ZoXFHor_ALyVtr9lf-hXWQ,1,That's poor customer service all around.,

3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,I got the email telling me what time our meals would be ready and what to do for curbside pickup.,
3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,When I arrived at the restaurant I called the number on the sign (same one as in the email) to let them know I was there to bring out our meals.,
3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,It rang for quite a long time.,
3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,Then someone hung up.,
3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,I tried two more times with the same result.,
3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,Someone would pick up the phone then immediately hang up!,
3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,I went inside and NO ONE was at the pickup station.,
3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,I went to the hostess who looked at me like I had two heads and sent me to the bar.,
3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,There were three take out orders on the bar.,
3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,It took a few minutes before a bartender recognized I was there.,
3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,Then the excuses started!,
3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,I finally got our meals and not a single employee apologized.,
3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,Not one!,
3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,The hostess is oblivious and the rest of the employees obviously don't care.,
3hfNzegVLCoKYPhuPzrSFw,1,Live and learn I guess.,

H_Gaz1rAyzizsPmMxU7rig,1,"I pointed out to her that if she were off the clock, she shouldn't be behind the bar and why.",
H_Gaz1rAyzizsPmMxU7rig,1,"After she proceeded to argue with me, we left! Smart move after reading all the reviews!!",
0BpqkAFUoAkjL-I8NEZ_Ww,3,Not a bad dining option at all considering the area.,
0BpqkAFUoAkjL-I8NEZ_Ww,3,"If you find yourself around here and happen to be in Horseheads' Arnot Mall, you'll notice that the dining options are slim.",
0BpqkAFUoAkjL-I8NEZ_Ww,3,Very slim.,
0BpqkAFUoAkjL-I8NEZ_Ww,3,"Make your way through the mall, through the nearly non-existent food court, and you'll realize that your best food option in the mall may very well be this BurgerPalace Tuesday.",

03d4VUFWlAR7PssD_fbLdg,3,She only asked how our food was at the very end of our dinner.,
03d4VUFWlAR7PssD_fbLdg,3,I couldn't eat all of my shrimp because there was a very small amount of cocktail sauce (out server did not ask how they were either) She also passed our table MULTIPLE TIMES AND DID NOT ASK ME FOR ANOTHER MARGARITA OR MY PARTER ANOTHER SODA.,

Z7umlYQaj1fyYwNMxUTvEA,1,We ordered three Beast Burgers and every single one of them were wrong.,

KrJHA8A7Gz53bj91hHRw6g,4,The waitress and hostess were both super sweet and interacted with my 2 year old playfully which I appreciated.,
KrJHA8A7Gz53bj91hHRw6g,4,"The food was good, however, my steak was well done rather than the medium well I asked for but I still ate it so it was pretty good.",

vNppSFFh6dG-nzO3P3ARmA,3,"Ordered through door dash last night, 3/3/2022.I got the chicken and broccoli pasta Alfredo.",

vNppSFFh6dG-nzO3P3ARmA,3,The food came and it looked as expected.,
vNppSFFh6dG-nzO3P3ARmA,3,I also ordered two shrimp skewers for my daughter.,
vNppSFFh6dG-nzO3P3ARmA,3,"When I ate the pasta, it literally had no flavor.",
vNppSFFh6dG-nzO3P3ARmA,3,And it was $18.,
vNppSFFh6dG-nzO3P3ARmA,3,Why...,
vNppSFFh6dG-nzO3P3ARmA,3,I have no idea.,
vNppSFFh6dG-nzO3P3ARmA,3,"The shrimp did not come on skewers, it just came into two plastic clamshell containers.",
vNppSFFh6dG-nzO3P3ARmA,3,Which that didn't matter to me.,
vNppSFFh6dG-nzO3P3ARmA,3,But there were 4 in each clamshell (2 separate ones for some reason)...I think it was like $6 for the 8 shrimp.,
vNppSFFh6dG-nzO3P3ARmA,3,The pasta just had no taste.,
vNppSFFh6dG-nzO3P3ARmA,3,I had to add more cheese and salt to taste anything.,
vNppSFFh6dG-nzO3P3ARmA,3,"I doubt I will return, this restaurant has not been good for years now and I gave it another chance but that's probably the last visit for me.",

S77mnV_avwFiTpYwMbvrYQ,1,I took my grandchildren here to have dinner....biggest mistake ever but this is the one place they wanted to eat after living in London for the last 2 years....,
S77mnV_avwFiTpYwMbvrYQ,1,there were maybe 5 tables in the entire building with customers and we waited almost 45 minutes for our food as I watched it sit in the window getting cold for at least 15 minutes before pointing it out to the waitress who brought it over....yes it was cold and uneatable,
S77mnV_avwFiTpYwMbvrYQ,1,....the waitress not 1 time checked on our table and the manager was too busy sitting at the bar having a drink and I had to gesture for him to come over and as I told him the issue he just looked at me and asked if I was ready to pay my check....,
S77mnV_avwFiTpYwMbvrYQ,1,I did not eat anything after the 1st bite nor did my grandchildren....not even an apology but he didn't mind swiping my card for $57....,
S77mnV_avwFiTpYwMbvrYQ,1,take your business elsewhere....,
S77mnV_avwFiTpYwMbvrYQ,1,we opted for McDonald s and got better service than at this so called restaurant,
Sp5bsYLPdJMQeCDs-6v_0w,2,Went there tonight with the family.,
Sp5bsYLPdJMQeCDs-6v_0w,2,What a mistake.,
Sp5bsYLPdJMQeCDs-6v_0w,2,Wife did the all you can eat salad.,
Sp5bsYLPdJMQeCDs-6v_0w,2,She only got 1 small plate of salad minus some of the items she requested.,
Sp5bsYLPdJMQeCDs-6v_0w,2,Never was asked if she wanted more.,
Sp5bsYLPdJMQeCDs-6v_0w,2,If you can't have a normal salad bar just shut it down.,
Sp5bsYLPdJMQeCDs-6v_0w,2,The servers can't follow the sheet you fill out for your salad so please just stop.,
Sp5bsYLPdJMQeCDs-6v_0w,2,The steaks we ordered eh. My son and I asked for medium Steaks his was perfect mine was a hockey puck.,
Sp5bsYLPdJMQeCDs-6v_0w,2,I dealt with it since the cooks clearly haven't been trained.,
Sp5bsYLPdJMQeCDs-6v_0w,2,Over all the experience here tonight helped us make the decision to always go to Long Horns.,
Sp5bsYLPdJMQeCDs-6v_0w,2,I should of disputed my cc charges but instead I'll warn others to keep far away from here.,

VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,A little background first on this place.,
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,I saw this place on Grubhub which was listed as The Captain's Boil.,
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,I was wondering why it wasn't on Yelp until I tried to add the business and BurgerPalace popped up.,
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,"The same location as well as phone number, I decided to call the place to find out who they actually were.",
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,They then told me they were BurgerPalace but also cooked for the Captain's Boil.,
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,My order through GrubHub:,
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,I saw nothing but seafood on this page and decided to give them a go through GrubHub.,
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,I ordered crab legs for 2 and plus the crawfish.,
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,I was feenin for some seafood and thought I would give them a whirl.,
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,Baddest and most expensive experience I've ever had in my life!!Crablegs:,
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,The crab legs for one comes with 2 clusters and 5 legs on each from what I was told.,
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,"So ordering for 2, I figured I had 4 clusters plus the corn and potatoes as well as the crawfish also with corn and potatoes.",
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,No dice!!I got ripped off bad on the crab legs.,
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,I had 2 clusters with the legs and they put in just the two bodies with no legs at all!,
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,I was so pissed!!,
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,Crawfish:,
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,"As this is crawfish season, how in the world did I end up with the tiniest crawfish imaginable!",
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,"There was not one decent size crawfish in my order at all, and I may have gotten only 10, and that's being generous.",
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,I probably got less than that.,
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,Captain Boils sauce:,
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,Are you kidding me??,
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,Really??,
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,This so called sauce was nothing more than messy at best.,
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,"It didn't bring out anything to me particularly in the seafood at all, well for the little seafood I did have.",
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,That was a total waste!!Corn on the cob:,
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,That tasted pretty good.,
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,Nice sweet corn with somewhat of a little kick is always favorable to me.,
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,I did have 3 of those which I think I should have 4-5 because I had 2 orders of the crab legs and 1 crawfish which also comes with it.,
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,"Again, ANOTHER EPIC FAIL!!Potatoes:",
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,That was a total joke as I was supposed to get 3 but they served them quartered up.,
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,I may have had 6 pieces of potatoes out of the whole thing!!,
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,Price:,
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,This whole total EPIC FAIL cost me $66.00 including the tip for my GrubHub driver.,
VbZ0e1vzeekjM1BXi7BO1Q,1,I have NEVER in my life had such disgusting piss poor service from a so-called seafood restaurant!,

bqu08vaIpE2BQkOzIRkOkQ,1,This place sucked.,
bqu08vaIpE2BQkOzIRkOkQ,1,"Our waitress was nice at first (keep in mind it was only a table of 4) we ordered food and drinks, our drinks came pretty quickly which was nice but while waiting for our food which took over an hour we never got refills, she came over to our table with someone else's food and told us the chef made the wrong thing.",
bqu08vaIpE2BQkOzIRkOkQ,1,We had been waiting for awhile and were all practically starving and tired.,
bqu08vaIpE2BQkOzIRkOkQ,1,She walked past us again and just threw trash on the floor right beside us.,
bqu08vaIpE2BQkOzIRkOkQ,1,The men's bathroom was even worse it was trashed and dirty.,
bqu08vaIpE2BQkOzIRkOkQ,1,"After more than an hour we got some of our food the fries were cold, the pasta was cold and practically uncooked we immediately got up and paid for our drinks (keep in mind only 3 out of 4 os us got the food) the manager said that the food was cold because when the chef made the food wrong she didn't want to take the food out and have someone waiting.",
bqu08vaIpE2BQkOzIRkOkQ,1,Even though one of us never even got our food.,
bqu08vaIpE2BQkOzIRkOkQ,1,This place was a total letdown and a mistake not to mention the fact the pasta made one of us sick.,

zcP8-GAt_Hk_2tTjTU4khA,1,The salad bar on TV looks so good...we go in every time they advertise the additional items...never changes and any mention of it falls on deaf ears.,

ezqppMkH5FxpVYke3fQbSg,4,Went in today..,
ezqppMkH5FxpVYke3fQbSg,4,place looked empty w ppl waiting for seating.,
ezqppMkH5FxpVYke3fQbSg,4,Opted to sit at bar after host said they were Shor staffed.,
ezqppMkH5FxpVYke3fQbSg,4,Also told us that the last time we went..,
ezqppMkH5FxpVYke3fQbSg,4,bartender Tiffany acknowledged us and was pleasant.,
ezqppMkH5FxpVYke3fQbSg,4,She also had tables in the bar.,
ezqppMkH5FxpVYke3fQbSg,4,We got our beers.,
ezqppMkH5FxpVYke3fQbSg,4,Had salad and an app.,
ezqppMkH5FxpVYke3fQbSg,4,Still not seating alot of ppl.,
ezqppMkH5FxpVYke3fQbSg,4,App was out in.,
ezqppMkH5FxpVYke3fQbSg,4,Tmely meter.,
ezqppMkH5FxpVYke3fQbSg,4,So glad to see the salad bR back.,

KWsBfcIIj6j9qNI-MYC62w,3,The takeout service is good overall even if it was a little behind yesterday.,
KWsBfcIIj6j9qNI-MYC62w,3,"I normally get a burger or a main dish which is always good, but yesterday I opt'd to get the brisket sandwich because I was looking for something a bit different.",
KWsBfcIIj6j9qNI-MYC62w,3,"I don't know what was more disappointing; the brisket sandwich which was nothing more than 3 very overcooked pieces of meat that were NOT brisket, or the 5-6 onion rings that came with it.",
KWsBfcIIj6j9qNI-MYC62w,3,You can't simply throw some sauce on meat and call it barbecue...,
KWsBfcIIj6j9qNI-MYC62w,3,RT needs to stick with their burgers because their idea of barbecue is well not cutting it.,
KWsBfcIIj6j9qNI-MYC62w,3,I'll give it 3/5 because normally the food is good and hopefully the disappointing faux brisket was an isolated incident.,

fNxLyuWFO0OYAUqfyd80oQ,1,"They did, however, offer to pay for a future meal, I declined how would that even work?",

eLoXSU4Rzgkmq1ndKiisEA,1,Went here a couple days ago- my husband and I haven't been here in years and thought why not let's go.,
eLoXSU4Rzgkmq1ndKiisEA,1,We get there and it was like 2:30 on a weekday so not too busy maybe 4 other tables if that.,
eLoXSU4Rzgkmq1ndKiisEA,1,"While ordering I ordered what I wanted, my husband tried to order what he wanted which included coleslaw, the waitress proceeded to tell him not to order it and how gross it was there.. ordered something else.",
eLoXSU4Rzgkmq1ndKiisEA,1,"I ordered a salad with mine which usually comes out first, all we got was our drinks after about 5 minutes and then she brought out salads and COLESLAW for the couple that came in after we ordered our drinks.",
eLoXSU4Rzgkmq1ndKiisEA,1,My husband and I just looked at each other and I asked the waitress if we could pay for our drinks and go.,
eLoXSU4Rzgkmq1ndKiisEA,1,She said we could just go and that she was sorry but I'm just very confused about what happened there lol.,

KnNABItqtp5BjKQNOM6qkA,1,"However, it's difficult because we stood in the lobby over five minutes and there wasn't a single person in there available to help seat us.",
KnNABItqtp5BjKQNOM6qkA,1,We walked out.,
5tELbXWl6h2q2WlYTXHSEA,4,"So as far as the food goes very average typical BurgerPalace much like Fridays, Applebees etc....",

589b1ruowZaXzuHXqD2h4w,2,Our server was working hard.,
589b1ruowZaXzuHXqD2h4w,2,They appeared short staffed.,
589b1ruowZaXzuHXqD2h4w,2,My daughter ordered a steak medium rare.,
589b1ruowZaXzuHXqD2h4w,2,It arrived well done.,

589b1ruowZaXzuHXqD2h4w,2,We were told it would be a few minutes.,
589b1ruowZaXzuHXqD2h4w,2,I watched five other orders arrive with fries.,
589b1ruowZaXzuHXqD2h4w,2,Still no fries for us.,

589b1ruowZaXzuHXqD2h4w,2,I had ordered the endless soup.,
589b1ruowZaXzuHXqD2h4w,2,When I tried to order a second bowl the waitress said she didn't know how long it would take.,
589b1ruowZaXzuHXqD2h4w,2,Waited 15 minutes and it had still nor arrived.,
589b1ruowZaXzuHXqD2h4w,2,The manager did comp one of our meals but it was a frustrating dinner.,
ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,Came here with a friend the other day.,
ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,"Parking was easy, and the restaurant was easy to find.",
ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,"Got seated pretty quickly, but ended up waiting a while for our food, especially considering the restaurant was essentially empty",
ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,.,
ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,"I got the salad bar, and my friend got the crispy chicken sandwich with fries (which shouldn't have taken that long to cook).",
ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,"The interior was nicer than expected, definitely a nice ambiance for a date night.",
ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,"My friend said that the chicken came out piping hot, and she could tell it was freshly cooked.",
ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,She said the chicken was beautifully crispy and had the perfect crunch on the outside.,
ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,She said the fries were average and didn't thrill her.,
ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,"She's had better, but she's also had worse.",
ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,I enjoyed the salad bar.,
ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,They had gloves available to wear before touching the utensils for infection control.,
ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,The ingredients appeared to be fresh and didn't seem to be sitting out for too long.,
ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,"It had salad ingredients, along with coleslaw (utterly disgusting), broccoli salad (delicious), and watermelon slices.",
ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,"The only proteins available were diced egg and a slimy diced ham, which was disappointing.",
ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,There were a variety of dressings available.,
ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,Prices on the menu appeared to be average.,
ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,"Overall, there wasn't anything spectacular that would draw me back again, but nothing adverse happened that would keep me from eating here again.",
ZeEehc4kIacKgfGLNiAkpg,3,I had an average experience at BurgerPalace,
LX3bKUG5kvae0irGgRJplQ,5,"I had the Chicken Fresco which was delicious, the light sauce it was in was perfect.",
LX3bKUG5kvae0irGgRJplQ,5,"It came with 2 sides, I picked the dirty rice and steamed broccoli, both were excellent.",
LX3bKUG5kvae0irGgRJplQ,5,The steamed broccoli was probably the best I ever had.,
LX3bKUG5kvae0irGgRJplQ,5,"My waitress, Kerri, was nice and never did I have to ask for a refill of my water, she was on top of it.",
LX3bKUG5kvae0irGgRJplQ,5,Highly recommend!,

SSQkMFPCaETSkJD2vFgWag,1,When we travel a BurgerPalace T is a reliable chain you know what your getting.,
SSQkMFPCaETSkJD2vFgWag,1,In my years going to BurgerPalace T this was beyond disapointing.,
SSQkMFPCaETSkJD2vFgWag,1,"The burger my wife after i finished 2nd round of salid bar and wife told they didnt start her burger would she like somthing else, her order was bacon cheese burger well no pink and tater tots.",
SSQkMFPCaETSkJD2vFgWag,1,In 32 years of marriage I have never known her to order any meat that hasn't been cremated.,
SSQkMFPCaETSkJD2vFgWag,1,When her order finally showed up no tater tots regular French fries and when she cut in to the Burger it was rare short of mooing.,
SSQkMFPCaETSkJD2vFgWag,1,The waiter told her that's how she ordered her Burger I about fell over in my seat.,
SSQkMFPCaETSkJD2vFgWag,1,He told her that if he took the Burger and tater tots back it would be another another 15 min.,
SSQkMFPCaETSkJD2vFgWag,1,The kitchen was busy .,
SSQkMFPCaETSkJD2vFgWag,1,We asked for the check but was told by another waiter That he was busy trying to find someone to approve a discount on her Burger.,
SSQkMFPCaETSkJD2vFgWag,1,So here's my message to the manager There was no discount and there'll be no return visit and we'll be sure to tell everybody what happened,
OdOqdhgFNdWysxINY1uDwQ,2,Went to BurgerPalace this weekend because it was hot and I wanted a salad bar option.,
OdOqdhgFNdWysxINY1uDwQ,2,The salad bar was very good!,
OdOqdhgFNdWysxINY1uDwQ,2,"My wife ordered a steak which was also pretty good, so food wise, pretty good.",
OdOqdhgFNdWysxINY1uDwQ,2,"Here is where my problem lies, I was in the Restaurant business for 16 years, I am a great tipper and I made my living that way for many years.",
OdOqdhgFNdWysxINY1uDwQ,2,"At the end of the meal, I asked for the check and showed that I would be paying for the meal with a credit card.",
OdOqdhgFNdWysxINY1uDwQ,2,"The server comes over and has a hand held devise which you put your card into, and they stand there holding it while you add the tip!!",
OdOqdhgFNdWysxINY1uDwQ,2,"What a horrible, horrible system, even being a good tipper I was shocked that this is how they handled card transaction.",
OdOqdhgFNdWysxINY1uDwQ,2,,
OdOqdhgFNdWysxINY1uDwQ,2,"Knowing that Card tips are tracked, I usually tip cash, even when using a card.",
OdOqdhgFNdWysxINY1uDwQ,2,"The server was visibly upset, and slammed our to go boxes on the table and walked away.",
OdOqdhgFNdWysxINY1uDwQ,2,I am sure she felt better when returning to the table after we left.,
OdOqdhgFNdWysxINY1uDwQ,2,"Please BurgerPalace rethink this process, don't put your customers and your employees in an uncomfortable position.",
-5nhyuuBsoxmDkEJ3qsAow,1,Absolutely horrible I got a order out from here I ordered salmon and a burger the salmon I got with 2 sides and it was grilled zucchini and mashed potatoes I double checked my receipt and it CLEARLY shows what I ordered but what I got?,
-5nhyuuBsoxmDkEJ3qsAow,1,A small salmon and 2 huge baked potatoes and they packaged it with 2 sour cream cups that had no lids it was spilled all over the food absolutely nasty I want a refund sadly I won't get one don't bother trying to eat here.,
-5nhyuuBsoxmDkEJ3qsAow,1,Thumbs down x100,
zlt47bKttOHvn96bgkK_9g,1,Called to double-check the hours and was told they were open until midnight.,
zlt47bKttOHvn96bgkK_9g,1,"Drove well out of our way to go there, arriving about 20 min later, just after 10 pm only to be told they were closed.",
zlt47bKttOHvn96bgkK_9g,1,The restaurant was busy so they weren't closing to lack of business.,
zlt47bKttOHvn96bgkK_9g,1,"Very frustrating, wasting our time and gas to drive out there.",
mwR3E1OuWhmucVzKbie9JA,3,"One of the few national chain sit down restaurants that we have locally, and it's sad that it's so hit or miss because people staying in the very very nearby 2 hotels probably gravitate to it as a national chain.",
mwR3E1OuWhmucVzKbie9JA,3,"Their salad bar has been my go to place, but have not been purchasing salads out since the pandemic started, can't wait to get back to it.",
mwR3E1OuWhmucVzKbie9JA,3,"Take out has been very very touchy, we always tip $1-$5 for takeout usually $3, but only a couple of times have we had Fabulous should be Expected Quality Service.",
mwR3E1OuWhmucVzKbie9JA,3,"Sometimes they put you on hold and never come back for curbside, a couple of times they put you on hold and someone comes and hangs up the phone, they miss putting lids on sauces etc in your takeout and it spills everywhere defeets the purpose of sauce of the side to dip or just try, they fully forget items in the order, they tell you that you Have to come in for curbside, it seems to be the culture there to work little, other times the meal is packaged up Perfectly with condiments and lids and everything!,",
mwR3E1OuWhmucVzKbie9JA,3,"it's just unpredictable, but what Should a National Chain be, it Should be Predictable, you should be able to expect the same Every Visit!",
mwR3E1OuWhmucVzKbie9JA,3,"They don't know here that I won a 50th Anniversary prize on Instagram from BurgerPalace I should wear my attire there, huh, lol.",
mwR3E1OuWhmucVzKbie9JA,3,"And even the marinara cups on the Crispy Mozzarella Sticks are inconsistent, some know to use the larger dipping cup, others use the small and you run out of sauce after 3 sticks, half the time it's been right and half the time wrong.",
mwR3E1OuWhmucVzKbie9JA,3,"And the attitude that they give, putting you on hold and hanging up, etc.",
mwR3E1OuWhmucVzKbie9JA,3,"Some of their new 50th Anniversary menu is pretty good, if you can get it made as it is meant to be---nice Philly Cheesesteak and Crispy Mozzarella sticks, don't know why I tried the Coconut Shrimp though, I don't like Coconut, lol, a no to those for me, lol, it was fresh coconut though, too strong for me, lol!",
mwR3E1OuWhmucVzKbie9JA,3,"And crazy dried out baked potato, must have been from 2 nights back, straight to the trash!",
mwR3E1OuWhmucVzKbie9JA,3,Other times the potatoes are Perfect!,
mwR3E1OuWhmucVzKbie9JA,3,"We've been there in the past for big church celebrations and sometimes just carryout for 1, but they don't see that a $3 carryout tip one day could come back as $100 small group sitdown tip.",
mwR3E1OuWhmucVzKbie9JA,3,"And all the email day by day specials they have, gosh I remember how good their steak was, might have to try the Sunday steak special.",
mwR3E1OuWhmucVzKbie9JA,3,"We're always nice and never know what we're gonna get there, smh!",

i1IKReLctf9JPCh_6sE-tQ,5,I did not keep the receipt tonight or would have included the name of our server.,
i1IKReLctf9JPCh_6sE-tQ,5,She was a blonde with short/med length hair.,

Y8KZNKvdgfRB8StjrXB6vg,1,We went in for a to go salad and while we were still getting our salad they were changing the utensil.,
Y8KZNKvdgfRB8StjrXB6vg,1,We wete the only ones there and being an African American I took it personal.,

9egA8FmH0FkA6acsPhtgtA,3,BurgerPalace has been that restaurant you always knew you gonna get a great meal.,
9egA8FmH0FkA6acsPhtgtA,3,You can count on 1 hand how many people were dining in restaurant on a Friday night.,
9egA8FmH0FkA6acsPhtgtA,3,That should of been my clue to go somewhere else.,
9egA8FmH0FkA6acsPhtgtA,3,Ordered Hickory Salmon w/ side Mashed potatoes & broccoli.,
9egA8FmH0FkA6acsPhtgtA,3,Looks good but the side portions are laughable.,
9egA8FmH0FkA6acsPhtgtA,3,I knew it must be a kids meal.,
9egA8FmH0FkA6acsPhtgtA,3,This cost $17.99 and these portions are so small.,
9egA8FmH0FkA6acsPhtgtA,3,The shrimp fajitas taste great but the condiments are petite.,

Mgr0fRzYE68_XTnRP7SCyw,3,"As we walked up to the restaurant, the trash receptacle outside was overloaded with trash laying around the door.",
Mgr0fRzYE68_XTnRP7SCyw,3,There was also an old sweet potato laying in the foyer that clearly had been there for awhile.,
Mgr0fRzYE68_XTnRP7SCyw,3,I watched on Monday an employee bringing out a tower of fresh ingredient replacements for the salad bar that where stacked on top of each other.,

JiWscoZDXQ_zHoDuNskBTw,4,"Eric went above and beyond to make our experience pleasurable, while always having a smile on his face.",
JiWscoZDXQ_zHoDuNskBTw,4,We couldn't believe the laziness of the manager and that she never stepped in to assist him or delegate other employees to help out during the Friday night dinner rush.,

b5NIoxfku1ZUzTaqKXSHDw,2,The plate was for a child.,
b5NIoxfku1ZUzTaqKXSHDw,2,The sandwich was the size sandwich you would feed a child.,
b5NIoxfku1ZUzTaqKXSHDw,2,My hubby had a salmon plate and it was overcooked I know I have many places I can go but here will no be the place.,

sZdYlENcU1NAK19pnqcEXg,4,But this particular day I wanted salmon but did not want to leave the house for it.,
sZdYlENcU1NAK19pnqcEXg,4,After googling and searching I found on GrubHub that BurgerPalace had salmon.,
sZdYlENcU1NAK19pnqcEXg,4,This salmon was a hickory glaze and I got a side of two loaded baked potatoes.,
sZdYlENcU1NAK19pnqcEXg,4,"I was so apprehensive about the entire thing, but I wanted to take a chance.",
sZdYlENcU1NAK19pnqcEXg,4,I am glad that I did not hesitate because it truly pulled me back in to how much their dishes do not disappoint.,
sZdYlENcU1NAK19pnqcEXg,4,Well some dishes!,
sZdYlENcU1NAK19pnqcEXg,4,I cannot wait to go in person to see how delicious this is straight off of the grill.,
sZdYlENcU1NAK19pnqcEXg,4,Even the bacon crumbles from the loaded baked potatoes were really really good.,
sZdYlENcU1NAK19pnqcEXg,4,I was also excited to see that the butter and sour cream for the baked potatoes was completely separated in their little small containers.,
sZdYlENcU1NAK19pnqcEXg,4,Oh the best part and I know it's more on the Grubhub side as well the delivery was amazingly fast.,
sZdYlENcU1NAK19pnqcEXg,4,Good job BurgerPalace I will be back I am now a fan again.,

EC5Q85sXJHCRT1OBYClI3A,1,But the food was actually disgusting....the burger I got was not only undercooked.,

9fVLLlDtpeWHsE94WHFqIA,2,The drinks were fine.,
9fVLLlDtpeWHsE94WHFqIA,2,But even a basic chicken salad was a clusterf*ck.,

9fVLLlDtpeWHsE94WHFqIA,2,And not sure what a was on top of the tilapia but it wasn't a cream sauce.,
9fVLLlDtpeWHsE94WHFqIA,2,It was more like something that was lurking around the pasta sauce and something rubbed off on it.,
9fVLLlDtpeWHsE94WHFqIA,2,At least the shrimp were not overcooked.,
9fVLLlDtpeWHsE94WHFqIA,2,That's a plus.,

TT2ggwr2_Mqr0x7lF6wRHA,3,She is always kind and friendly as well as quick and efficient at serving us.,
TT2ggwr2_Mqr0x7lF6wRHA,3,"In my experience, it is hit or miss at many BurgerPalace as to whether or not they will cook items, like their salmon, to order (i.e. medium) or not.",
TT2ggwr2_Mqr0x7lF6wRHA,3,"This one does which makes for a perfectly mouther-watering, buttery delicious piece of fish.",
TT2ggwr2_Mqr0x7lF6wRHA,3,"We usually only order the salad bar and add grilled chicken and/or grilled salmon which they prepare very nicely (except with an occasion new cook, then it may require a re-order).What",
TT2ggwr2_Mqr0x7lF6wRHA,3,would,
TT2ggwr2_Mqr0x7lF6wRHA,3,make it a 4-5 star review for me?,
TT2ggwr2_Mqr0x7lF6wRHA,3,More grilled and healthy entreÃÅe and options that are scratch cooked with fresh spices and herds and not heavy starchy sauces.,
TT2ggwr2_Mqr0x7lF6wRHA,3,"In my opinion the menu is mostly starch heavy, fried, or heavily sauce/gravy heavy that makes them taste like every other processed food, fast food chain.",
TT2ggwr2_Mqr0x7lF6wRHA,3,The Pic's are from a previouse visit,
wPrWzEzm8XR6a9hr3v9cXg,1,Ordered food well in advance then spent almost 20 minutes waiting in lobby.,
wPrWzEzm8XR6a9hr3v9cXg,1,Figure out your timing people it's not that hard for goodness sakes.,
xsXCDtnGOncnnsaLc73O3A,5,Good food great service.,
xsXCDtnGOncnnsaLc73O3A,5,Stopped on our way home and missed having a BurgerPalace Did not disappoint,
YSdJp0SpDiiC4Lf4nFXxGw,4,This place needs more than a 2 star overall review.,
YSdJp0SpDiiC4Lf4nFXxGw,4,I was in town at the casino and we stopped in for lunch.,
YSdJp0SpDiiC4Lf4nFXxGw,4,The food was not which to die for but as a picky eater I found it to be acceptable.,
YSdJp0SpDiiC4Lf4nFXxGw,4,We had the glazed chicken and mozzarella sticks with the salad bar for both of us.,
YSdJp0SpDiiC4Lf4nFXxGw,4,"Everything was fresh, hot, didn't seem like it was sitting around all day and night, staff was friendly and chatty, alcohol was good and the price was a little high but ie the 4 star and not 5.",
YSdJp0SpDiiC4Lf4nFXxGw,4,I'll eat here again.,
U64t5qQbPa2HLuicAh1q4g,1,Restaurant has brand new cooks and wait staff.,
U64t5qQbPa2HLuicAh1q4g,1,"Our order was messed up from the get go, starting with the server forgetting to click send on the computer.",
U64t5qQbPa2HLuicAh1q4g,1,We waited almost 2 hours for our meals.,
U64t5qQbPa2HLuicAh1q4g,1,Then food was lousy!,
U64t5qQbPa2HLuicAh1q4g,1,My daughters burger tasted funny.,
U64t5qQbPa2HLuicAh1q4g,1,Our fried shrimp was barely fried.,
U64t5qQbPa2HLuicAh1q4g,1,We just gave up.,
U64t5qQbPa2HLuicAh1q4g,1,The manager deducted all the food.,
U64t5qQbPa2HLuicAh1q4g,1,He was at his wits end with all the staff.,
U64t5qQbPa2HLuicAh1q4g,1,The young man doing hostess duty and busing duty was absolutely wonderful!!!,
U64t5qQbPa2HLuicAh1q4g,1,"Don't bother driving in this restaurant's direction, it's worth the wait at any other place.",
U64t5qQbPa2HLuicAh1q4g,1,Will never go there again!,
8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,I usually go here about once a week.,
8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,Service at the bar is always friendly and good is decent for this area.,
8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,"Tonight, not so much.",
8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,I sat at the bar as I usually do and waited for about 5 minutes which is normal and I don't mind to be honest since there is only one bartender and no servers in that part of the restaurant.,
8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,"I wasn't greeted by the bartender, instead was looked at rather rudely and asked if I was picking up an order.",
8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,"I said no I am here to order and she just said, for here?",
8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,"Anyway, was given a menu, wasn't asked if I would like anything to drink so I asked for a yuengling, was told they didn't have it so asked for a corona.",
8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,"Was given the beer with no lime or a ""here you go"".",
8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,Was it a little busy?,
8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,"Yea, was it my fault, nope.",
8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,"When I paid, no have a good night or anything.",
8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,I have worked in the food and bar industry for my whole working career and cannot stand rude service.,
8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,"If I see you being cordial with other customers and not me for some odd reason, not sure what the deal is.",
8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,I'll walk right out if that person is behind the bar when I go back.,
8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,Now the food.,
8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,I never expect something amazing since it's a chain restaurant but it's food.,
8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,I've never really gotten anything I don't like.,
8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,"However, this time I knew the burger was a frozen Patty that you can get in bulk, you could just taste an odd flavor.",
8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,There were two tiny pieces of onion on it and rotten lettuce.,
8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,"I understand that meat is expensive right now and the place may need to cut some corners by ordering prefrozen beef, but lettuce and onions tho??",
8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,You can get ecoli from bad lettuce and it is super cheap.,
8HpAkJoo5bAXKO9npuyeLw,1,Just seems places don't care anymore to serve decent fresh food and have a friendly bartender.,
xPKITBHuJB9NvxshIyYizA,1,Place is not good.,
xPKITBHuJB9NvxshIyYizA,1,Food was super suspect.,
xPKITBHuJB9NvxshIyYizA,1,Queso and chips was like a humus.,
xPKITBHuJB9NvxshIyYizA,1,"Asked for more chips, never came.",
xPKITBHuJB9NvxshIyYizA,1,Salmon was decent.,
xPKITBHuJB9NvxshIyYizA,1,Steak was junk.,
XiaD2S7Vc6Bocg-d4S88FQ,2,The waiter was one of the best we have ever had!,
XiaD2S7Vc6Bocg-d4S88FQ,2,His name is Lowell C.,
XiaD2S7Vc6Bocg-d4S88FQ,2,He should have a job at a classier establishment.,
XiaD2S7Vc6Bocg-d4S88FQ,2,"He is on the ball, friendly and pleasant.",
XiaD2S7Vc6Bocg-d4S88FQ,2,The french fries were excellent.,
XiaD2S7Vc6Bocg-d4S88FQ,2,Floors need major attention.,
XiaD2S7Vc6Bocg-d4S88FQ,2,Very sticky.,
XiaD2S7Vc6Bocg-d4S88FQ,2,"I thought I had stepped in gum, but nope.",
XiaD2S7Vc6Bocg-d4S88FQ,2,Carpet and tile very sticky.,
XiaD2S7Vc6Bocg-d4S88FQ,2,Boyfriend noticed it too.,
XiaD2S7Vc6Bocg-d4S88FQ,2,Chicken was tough and soda was flat.,
XiaD2S7Vc6Bocg-d4S88FQ,2,The dining room is open even though business looks deserted from the road.,
g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,My husband and I went to this location to celebrate our wedding anniversary.,
g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,What a total nightmare!,
g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,We sat down at the bar and ordered drinks.,
g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,I ordered a Long Island iced tea.,
g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,Being a former bartender I could tell that there was almost no alcohol in it at all.,
g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,It was so sweet that I couldn't even drink it.,
g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,"I sent it back and ended up ordering a beer which I don't like to drink, but I knew that it was something that the bartender couldn't screw up.",
g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,We ended up ordering the queso cheese and chips as an appetizer.,
g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,The order literally came out within two minutes.,
g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,"The cheese wasn't even warm, and the chips were totally stale.",
g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,"They ended up sending it back to the kitchen, and all they did was reheat the cheese, and the cook made fresh chips.",
g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,The cheese was still very bland and did not have much flavor.,
g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,Two strikes against them so far!,
g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,I ended up ordering chicken wings as my entreÃÅe.,
g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,"Most of them were very small wings, smaller than my pinky finger.",
g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,"There were only two large wings that were in there, and they were full of fat!",
g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,They were absolutely disgusting!,
g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,I couldn't even eat them.,
g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,Thanks for ruining our wedding anniversary dinner BurgerPalace in Charles town West Virginia!,
g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,Three strikes and you're out.,
g07zEJp8DzLRxz2XVDBrHw,1,Never had such a horrible restaurant experience in my life.,
2loApySXvuoguBEMPrqg9Q,3,Ugh.,
2loApySXvuoguBEMPrqg9Q,3,So hungry figured a salad can't be that bad... and it was surprisingly pretty tasty but man it smells like it needs to be washed in there.,
2loApySXvuoguBEMPrqg9Q,3,"Girl helping with to go orders using her fingers to clean her eyes, playing with her hair - lawd take me now.",
2loApySXvuoguBEMPrqg9Q,3,Everybody looked like they woke up and went to work - no effort.,
2loApySXvuoguBEMPrqg9Q,3,I'm bougie don't trust me if you like side of the road food go for it.,
2loApySXvuoguBEMPrqg9Q,3,Me and my household staying out this place.,
jEidw5OF7-sCWYx7rv8zVg,1,"Poor customer service, no greeting, no eye contact, appear as annoyed when you request items that are missing from the order you paid for, no sense of urgency, no accommodations made for inconveniences, no manners in general.",
jEidw5OF7-sCWYx7rv8zVg,1,To go orders treated as trash and thrown together and missing items.,
5TIE08D_g-22WSsDZGT31g,1,Every time I order online or on the phone my food is never ready when I get there I still have to wait for 20 to 30 min to get it and my break is only 30 min,
CJzk5rdK6j9yv5uhB_G-NQ,1,"Like the previous review mentioned, this location deserves ZERO stars.",
CJzk5rdK6j9yv5uhB_G-NQ,1,It takes a lot for me to write a review about anything but they had this one coming.,
CJzk5rdK6j9yv5uhB_G-NQ,1,Let's start with the fact that my friend and I both got food poisoning from the salad bar of which we are still medicating for.,
CJzk5rdK6j9yv5uhB_G-NQ,1,Let's also add the fact that we weren't seated for more than 5 minutes because NO ONE HERE WORKS.,
CJzk5rdK6j9yv5uhB_G-NQ,1,I'm sure the GM would be shocked to know the employees here stand around like a gaggle of geese gossiping and joking around instead of serving paying customers.,
CJzk5rdK6j9yv5uhB_G-NQ,1,"The salad bar was lacking several items and I had to ask the server to refill eggs, croutons, corn, cranberries and several other things TWICE and it never happened.",
CJzk5rdK6j9yv5uhB_G-NQ,1,She didn't bother to check on us for anything until we were ready to go so she could get a fat tip and had the audacity to complain when I gave her 12% out of decency.,
CJzk5rdK6j9yv5uhB_G-NQ,1,She literally earned NOTHING but I was raised to tip at least 10% even if the service is terrible and the fact she loudly complained making a scene in the restaurant is an experience I have never had before.,
CJzk5rdK6j9yv5uhB_G-NQ,1,The entire staff should be fired here.,
CJzk5rdK6j9yv5uhB_G-NQ,1,This is the worst Ruby's I've ever been to and amongst the worst 3 dining experiences I've ever had.,
CJzk5rdK6j9yv5uhB_G-NQ,1,0/5 DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!,
T-_uxxtOAyqEyt3h-cOhng,1,If I could rate this location a zero for customer service I would.,
T-_uxxtOAyqEyt3h-cOhng,1,I had been a frequent visitor of this location.,
T-_uxxtOAyqEyt3h-cOhng,1,There's never no one there to place to go orders.,
T-_uxxtOAyqEyt3h-cOhng,1,"The employees walk around and ignore you standing without asking for help and get an attitude when you do ask for help, siting it's not their job(bartender).",
T-_uxxtOAyqEyt3h-cOhng,1,The female day bartender is extremely rude and argumentative.,
T-_uxxtOAyqEyt3h-cOhng,1,I have decided to no longer frequent this location as the customer service is just NONE and AGGRAVATING.,
T-_uxxtOAyqEyt3h-cOhng,1,I waited 10 minutes for someone to place my order and this was the person clocking in for work and another 20 minutes for my order that I was told would take 10 minutes.,
T-_uxxtOAyqEyt3h-cOhng,1,I had to inquire about my order and of course I could tell it had been sitting around as it was not warm.,
T-_uxxtOAyqEyt3h-cOhng,1,I work 5 minutes away and wasted my entire lunch dealing with unprofessional and rude employees.,
T-_uxxtOAyqEyt3h-cOhng,1,It starts at the top.,
T-_uxxtOAyqEyt3h-cOhng,1,Management apparently allow this type of behavior.,
T-_uxxtOAyqEyt3h-cOhng,1,DON'T WASTE YOUR PRECIOUS TIME AT THE SULLIVAN ROAD LOCATION.,
T-_uxxtOAyqEyt3h-cOhng,1,HORRIBLE SERVICE.,
Ti_vODmrX2G-kQXQFbOKXQ,4,"Look, staffing shortages are bad everywhere.",
Ti_vODmrX2G-kQXQFbOKXQ,4,"If you can't be patient, then cook your own darn food.",
Ti_vODmrX2G-kQXQFbOKXQ,4,The staff I dealt with at this BurgerPalace was excellent.,
Ti_vODmrX2G-kQXQFbOKXQ,4,"There weren't enough of them for the amount of filled tables, but they were working their tails off and I appreciated them very much.",
Ti_vODmrX2G-kQXQFbOKXQ,4,I think my waitress (twice) was named Nelly (Nellie?) and she was an angel.,
Ti_vODmrX2G-kQXQFbOKXQ,4,"Let's not forget that the most important part of a restaurant's business is the food, eh?",
Ti_vODmrX2G-kQXQFbOKXQ,4,It is all excellent.,
Ti_vODmrX2G-kQXQFbOKXQ,4,Somehow the kitchen is able to crank out amazing food even though I'm sure they're short staffed too.,
Ti_vODmrX2G-kQXQFbOKXQ,4,The bar makes amazing drinks and the food is good.,
Ti_vODmrX2G-kQXQFbOKXQ,4,"If you can get over yourself about waiting a bit to get your stuff, then this is the perfect place for you.",
Ti_vODmrX2G-kQXQFbOKXQ,4,Try it out...seriously.,

OI568gtIzyO1if0wQhGp4g,5,My friend and I had a great time and look forward to coming back,
51c766ovJoE3z7PeXROUCw,3,Slow being seated(10mins from the time we walked in).,
51c766ovJoE3z7PeXROUCw,3,There were only 2 of us.,
51c766ovJoE3z7PeXROUCw,3,Our waiter was bussing tables and being hostess.,
51c766ovJoE3z7PeXROUCw,3,"After bein seated l, we were given menus and she dissapeared for another 15mins.",
51c766ovJoE3z7PeXROUCw,3,We just decided to go get the salad bar since we could serve ourselves.,
51c766ovJoE3z7PeXROUCw,3,It was not busy they are just slow!,
QJMlPez8tudGCcVrECSFOg,3,This was a mixed experience.,
QJMlPez8tudGCcVrECSFOg,3,"On the plus side, the food was surprisingly good.",
QJMlPez8tudGCcVrECSFOg,3,"I had the 8 oz sirloin, and it came medium, as ordered.",
QJMlPez8tudGCcVrECSFOg,3,Tasted good and served hot.,
QJMlPez8tudGCcVrECSFOg,3,Fries and broccoli decent.,
QJMlPez8tudGCcVrECSFOg,3,"That said, service was painfully slow.",
QJMlPez8tudGCcVrECSFOg,3,"I came in a large party, around 6:30.",
QJMlPez8tudGCcVrECSFOg,3,"We didn't get out til 9, and my water was never refilled in 2.5 hours, despite me asking.",
QJMlPez8tudGCcVrECSFOg,3,"Probably not a bad option for a small group or family, but look elsewhere for larger parties.",
DBztaHu63EQBtTrkf4_0XQ,1,"Ordered two appetizers, the coconut shrimp and loaded fried, as a Grubhub order to be delivered to the hotel directly behind the restaurant.",
DBztaHu63EQBtTrkf4_0XQ,1,I was traveling alone with my daughter and we got into our hotel around 8 so wanted to have something delivered quickly.,
DBztaHu63EQBtTrkf4_0XQ,1,We ordered the 2 appetizers with the delivery fee and tip our total was $36.00.,
DBztaHu63EQBtTrkf4_0XQ,1,"When our food arrived... over an hour later, my daughters 6 pieces of shrimp were cold and my ""fries"" that had to replaced with tots since they were out of fries, were cold as well!",
DBztaHu63EQBtTrkf4_0XQ,1,The loaded fries are supposed to come topped with queso and shredded cheese.,
DBztaHu63EQBtTrkf4_0XQ,1,The food was so cold the queso had hardened!,
DBztaHu63EQBtTrkf4_0XQ,1,It was a total waste of money.,
ecsKAD3gKEIaD4kg7KFDew,1,"Went into the dining room for supper at around 8:15 and waited 30 minutes before going to the bar and was asked ""What""?",
ecsKAD3gKEIaD4kg7KFDew,1,Really that's how you greet someone.,
ecsKAD3gKEIaD4kg7KFDew,1,I just left.,
ecsKAD3gKEIaD4kg7KFDew,1,No wonder this place is dead and has 2 stars.,
ecsKAD3gKEIaD4kg7KFDew,1,I went to Malone's across the street.,
k0YcQt7Hue04lvcsCu2Huw,1,No one was at the front to seat our party.,
k0YcQt7Hue04lvcsCu2Huw,1,A young lady who was there waiting on here take out food that should have been an hour prior motioned to someone around the corner.,
k0YcQt7Hue04lvcsCu2Huw,1,The manager and an employee emerged and began arguing in front of us.,
k0YcQt7Hue04lvcsCu2Huw,1,Two RED flags in less than 5 minutes and we should have left immediately but decided to stay and dine in.,
k0YcQt7Hue04lvcsCu2Huw,1,Tables weren't clean and restaurant was nearly empty.,
k0YcQt7Hue04lvcsCu2Huw,1,Bottom line it took nearly an hour for our food to arrive.,
k0YcQt7Hue04lvcsCu2Huw,1,Service was subpar.,
k0YcQt7Hue04lvcsCu2Huw,1,We will not visit this RT again.,
k0YcQt7Hue04lvcsCu2Huw,1,This is disheartening because we would eat here at times passing through Atlanta before COVID pandemic.,
k0YcQt7Hue04lvcsCu2Huw,1,Should have read reviews before dining because each conveyed the truth.,
k0YcQt7Hue04lvcsCu2Huw,1,Complete overall needed.,

45vVtkNvTaFracbSrJkbJw,1,When we got there it wasn't even busy.,
45vVtkNvTaFracbSrJkbJw,1,The hostess was very incompetent.,
45vVtkNvTaFracbSrJkbJw,1,She just kept waking back and forth not giving any update on the wait time.,
45vVtkNvTaFracbSrJkbJw,1,Once we finally were seated our waiter kept asking if we wanted to sit in the front instead even after saying we were fine where we were.,
45vVtkNvTaFracbSrJkbJw,1,The food was decent and came out in a timely manner.,
45vVtkNvTaFracbSrJkbJw,1,Definitely train your employees on basic customer service skills..,
3T3VkMIdT-aqgBeOSjfGnw,1,This location is disgusting!!!!,
3T3VkMIdT-aqgBeOSjfGnw,1,"When we walked in, we thought we were at an abandoned Piccadilly's!",
3T3VkMIdT-aqgBeOSjfGnw,1,"The salad bar is like right past the front entrance (think summertime, now think flies...flying everything), the set-up and decor if you can it that is totally gross and was a total turn-off.",
3T3VkMIdT-aqgBeOSjfGnw,1,The floor was filthy and after we were seated we look to the the right and some unfit parent has allowed their non-talented child to scribble mess all over the wall in crayon...,
3T3VkMIdT-aqgBeOSjfGnw,1,WTF allows this???,
3T3VkMIdT-aqgBeOSjfGnw,1,"And what's really disturbing is that the establishment did not even remotely try to remove it or paint over it, but felt it was ok to seat customers next to it?",

3T3VkMIdT-aqgBeOSjfGnw,1,"The service was....I'm not sure how to describe...her intentions were sincere, but she yapped way too much (not in the mood to hear anything when your food is unappetizing), she kept coming to our table every 5 minutes to check, yet kept bringing wrong sh!@ and it was beyond annoying!",
3T3VkMIdT-aqgBeOSjfGnw,1,"The cheeseburger was, ugh, could've gotten a better one at BK, asked for everything on side, but of course it came with everything on it, my friends asked for no sour cream on dried-out potatoes and of course it came dripping and oozing with sour cream",
3T3VkMIdT-aqgBeOSjfGnw,1,", we asked for very little ice in our drinks and the glass comes filled to the top (we ask the waitress for a glass and spoon to take out all of the ice, she watches us do this, yet NEVER offers to have the drinks remade)....and the only response we get from the waitress is, ""I told them too, I told them too.""",
3T3VkMIdT-aqgBeOSjfGnw,1,"Uh, that's not a an appropriate response if you keep delivering the wrong sh!@ to people's table.",
3T3VkMIdT-aqgBeOSjfGnw,1,Will NEVER EVER come to this location again!,
Ay4ewyM_sjFXJxT_ehzdaw,1,Wait time was just horrible.,
Ay4ewyM_sjFXJxT_ehzdaw,1,Server was more worried about other things then our table.,
Ay4ewyM_sjFXJxT_ehzdaw,1,Went to the gas staion after to buy things to eat for dinner.,
Ay4ewyM_sjFXJxT_ehzdaw,1,If they really cared about good food and service they would fire the entire crew.,
Ay4ewyM_sjFXJxT_ehzdaw,1,Hire someone to come in and clean the place.,
Ay4ewyM_sjFXJxT_ehzdaw,1,Then do a regrand opening.,

lcYvu8o-Wzfdv6xHtpzC7Q,1,People are wondering if they are closed.,
lcYvu8o-Wzfdv6xHtpzC7Q,1,The manager shld be fired for a piss poor staff.,
lcYvu8o-Wzfdv6xHtpzC7Q,1,The walls are filthy in the booths.,
lcYvu8o-Wzfdv6xHtpzC7Q,1,Gross!!,
EWPktxGrTiIho5XsGzF-LA,1,Visiting from out of town,
EWPktxGrTiIho5XsGzF-LA,1,and,
EWPktxGrTiIho5XsGzF-LA,1,came in for a late lunch after traveling.,
EWPktxGrTiIho5XsGzF-LA,1,"We were a party of three and came in the middle of the afternoon and though the restaurant was empty except for the bar, we waited for 5-10 min to be seated.",
EWPktxGrTiIho5XsGzF-LA,1,"When someone came to seat us, she said that she saw us waiting but did not apologize for making us wait or offer a reason as to why.",
EWPktxGrTiIho5XsGzF-LA,1,Our server was polite and friendly but was not very attentive; it took a long time for her to come back and take our order.,
EWPktxGrTiIho5XsGzF-LA,1,The restaurant remained fairly empty during our time there and our appetizer and food still took longer than it should've (2 hamburgers and a ceaser salad).,
EWPktxGrTiIho5XsGzF-LA,1,"When our food did come, she brought us a salad without any silverware.",
EWPktxGrTiIho5XsGzF-LA,1,"When we asked her to bring silverware, she said she would but never came back.",
EWPktxGrTiIho5XsGzF-LA,1,We had to go up to the bar to request them.,
EWPktxGrTiIho5XsGzF-LA,1,I would not recommend coming back.,
EWPktxGrTiIho5XsGzF-LA,1,The food was okay but wait staff had poor customer service.,
5WmJBEg4e2L8Hi4qSJapLQ,5,"Good service , excellant salad bar . Generous drinks .worth the money more than other comparable chain restaurants.",
Jjj4xvhi78_g4L6pnwZWfQ,2,"Got a few items to go, including two Cobb Salads.",
Jjj4xvhi78_g4L6pnwZWfQ,2,They forgot the egg on both and were closed by the time I noticed.,
t3xgOWYCu7aB6mTZauNNmg,5,Luke & Dalton we're our bartenders and they both were absolutely phenomenal!,
t3xgOWYCu7aB6mTZauNNmg,5,"As Luke was coming off of shift, Dalton took over our check at the bar.",
t3xgOWYCu7aB6mTZauNNmg,5,"My fianceÃÅ & myself both ordered hot & dirty martinis, one set from Luke and my fianceÃÅ's second from Dalton and they both made the perfect build of the cocktail.",
t3xgOWYCu7aB6mTZauNNmg,5,"Food was also spectacular for a chain, we have had such luck at our local RT in upstate NY.",
t3xgOWYCu7aB6mTZauNNmg,5,Highly recommend Somerset!,
muka2I_-aW7hU6fBeqQTmw,3,Understaffed and you can tell.,
muka2I_-aW7hU6fBeqQTmw,3,The staff was nice and the food was good.,
muka2I_-aW7hU6fBeqQTmw,3,"The staff wore masks, some under the nose, but still better than many other places.",
muka2I_-aW7hU6fBeqQTmw,3,One of our meals didn't get their side of mashed potatoes until we were leaving.,
muka2I_-aW7hU6fBeqQTmw,3,The waiter put it in a to go box which was nice but a little frustrating that it wasn't served with the meal.,
muka2I_-aW7hU6fBeqQTmw,3,"Overall, okay.",
r2JZDGWoGNweOww6VZNSNA,5,BurgerPalace in Somerset is a good restaurant .,
r2JZDGWoGNweOww6VZNSNA,5,Everyone wears a mask and they seem to clean after every customer I feel very safe eating there.,
r2JZDGWoGNweOww6VZNSNA,5,"The food is reasonably priced and very good ,wide selection of food which is rare in this time of Covid 19.",
r2JZDGWoGNweOww6VZNSNA,5,Service is also very good no complaints whatsoever.,
maXCVQZtyZG0AfmBeYejyg,1,Was in the North Charleston BurgerPalace a few months ago.,
maXCVQZtyZG0AfmBeYejyg,1,All I will say about the visit is I watched an employee wipe down the salad bar and threw everything on the floor and didn't bother to clean it up and walked away.,
maXCVQZtyZG0AfmBeYejyg,1,I will never ever ever go to BurgerPalace again after seeing that.,
maXCVQZtyZG0AfmBeYejyg,1,That Has to be a health violation.,
maXCVQZtyZG0AfmBeYejyg,1,If you are thinking about going to this BurgerPalace don't just don't.,
jDEE-amP8AJ9H_LrAgl6gw,1,"Oh man, where to start.",
jDEE-amP8AJ9H_LrAgl6gw,1,"BurgerPalace used to be pretty good about a decade ago, but times have changed.",
jDEE-amP8AJ9H_LrAgl6gw,1,The place was so under staffed they could only have maybe 10 tables out of 40 or so open at one time.,
jDEE-amP8AJ9H_LrAgl6gw,1,"There were two waitresses for the entire place, and I don't think there was anyone designated to bus the tables because empty tables stayed dirty the entire time we were there.",
jDEE-amP8AJ9H_LrAgl6gw,1,"I'm not sure who was washing dishes, but we ordered our water and they came in dirty cups.",
jDEE-amP8AJ9H_LrAgl6gw,1,"We asked for different glasses of water, because the grime on the inside of the cup wiped away with a finger swipe and I didn't want my kids drinking out of dirty cups.",
jDEE-amP8AJ9H_LrAgl6gw,1,We get our new glasses of water and those cups were dirty as well.,
jDEE-amP8AJ9H_LrAgl6gw,1,"After asking for clean glasses our waitress didn't come back to our table for a while, which is fine as there were literally only two of them, but it did feel a little personal.",
jDEE-amP8AJ9H_LrAgl6gw,1,"We finally got to order our food, and my husband ordered the Triple Play Platter with ribs, shrimp, and chicken ($22 bucks)...the portions of this plate were...disappointing and definitely not worth 22 dollars.",
jDEE-amP8AJ9H_LrAgl6gw,1,The rest of the food was mediocre.,
jDEE-amP8AJ9H_LrAgl6gw,1,"We did tip our waitress because regardless of my feelings towards the cleanliness and food portions, she did bust her tail and was friendly.",
jDEE-amP8AJ9H_LrAgl6gw,1,We will not return.,
P7pkB7qWX_kBljRd_OEWkg,4,We had a wonderful meal at this BurgerPalace We enjoyed their salad bar though a bit small they were quick to refill the bar and replenish any toppings that were gone.,
P7pkB7qWX_kBljRd_OEWkg,4,Their loaded fries were amazing!,
P7pkB7qWX_kBljRd_OEWkg,4,We got cheesecake to go and throughly enjoyed the friendly service and kindness of our hostess.,
V38MImP_Nivg4jzroDWzCw,1,"Seven shrimp, one baked potato $17.49 is absolutely ridiculous!!",
V38MImP_Nivg4jzroDWzCw,1,"While ordering was told to choose two sides minutes later the waitress comes back to the table and says there had been a change ""mid day "" and my meal only came with one side.",
V38MImP_Nivg4jzroDWzCw,1,No change to the price!,
V38MImP_Nivg4jzroDWzCw,1,Manager came over said I'm sorry and agreed it was ridiculous but couldn't do anything about it.,
V38MImP_Nivg4jzroDWzCw,1,"While leaving a woman comes in with a small dog on a leash ""no it was not a service dog "".",
V38MImP_Nivg4jzroDWzCw,1,First and last time I eat there.,
V38MImP_Nivg4jzroDWzCw,1,I now know why BurgerPalace is becoming a thing of the past.,
aHSUT7uSg_rsn4-5nRyBKw,1,Eaten at plenty of BurgerPalace this one is a sh*t hole.,
aHSUT7uSg_rsn4-5nRyBKw,1,No way to sugar coat it.,
aHSUT7uSg_rsn4-5nRyBKw,1,"""Menu change in the middle of the day"" which included no longer getting 2 sides with the meal but the price being the same.",
aHSUT7uSg_rsn4-5nRyBKw,1,The staff was unprofessional and looked thrown away (manager included).,
aHSUT7uSg_rsn4-5nRyBKw,1,"The food, decent at best.",
aHSUT7uSg_rsn4-5nRyBKw,1,Mashed potatoes were cold.,
aHSUT7uSg_rsn4-5nRyBKw,1,There is a reason so many of these places keep going out of business and this one is a prime example.,
aHSUT7uSg_rsn4-5nRyBKw,1,"Side note: As we were leaving a woman walks in with her dog on a leash, not a service dog.",
aHSUT7uSg_rsn4-5nRyBKw,1,Just a regular little nappy chihuahua.,
phYlZqZMJIZvFaidRaZ7Qg,5,I really wish I took a picture of our food!!!!,
phYlZqZMJIZvFaidRaZ7Qg,5,We walked in a hour before close and really expected really quick and horrible service.,
phYlZqZMJIZvFaidRaZ7Qg,5,"AmariRay, Crystal and Myra are employees to make a change.",
phYlZqZMJIZvFaidRaZ7Qg,5,They are a awesome group of individuals also the cook.,
phYlZqZMJIZvFaidRaZ7Qg,5,Although we came in late we was served and tended to as if we came in early.,
phYlZqZMJIZvFaidRaZ7Qg,5,Our food was so delicious.,
phYlZqZMJIZvFaidRaZ7Qg,5,Service was a 10 out of 10!!!!!!!,

phYlZqZMJIZvFaidRaZ7Qg,5,Food perfect!!!,
phYlZqZMJIZvFaidRaZ7Qg,5,Service perfect!!!!!,
phYlZqZMJIZvFaidRaZ7Qg,5,A award winning group of employees tonight.,
phYlZqZMJIZvFaidRaZ7Qg,5,$130.00 + on everything and well worth it!!!!!,
phYlZqZMJIZvFaidRaZ7Qg,5,See you all soon!!,
LvB2qv8sJfBmSAecxeKl4g,1,the management was not very nice while we were there.,
LvB2qv8sJfBmSAecxeKl4g,1,They made us wait 20 minutes just to come an tell us that what we ordered was not on the menu today.,
LvB2qv8sJfBmSAecxeKl4g,1,It created a very uncomfortable situation for my family and friends on my birthday.,
LvB2qv8sJfBmSAecxeKl4g,1,I wouldn't suggest taking your FAMILY here if you want it to be special.,
bY4zTsHpJSNh1GIEv0E1Lg,1,If i could give it a big fat Zero I would .,
bY4zTsHpJSNh1GIEv0E1Lg,1,Literally the worst and most disgusting place I have ever been to in my life .,
bY4zTsHpJSNh1GIEv0E1Lg,1,Please don't go here .,
bY4zTsHpJSNh1GIEv0E1Lg,1,Omg never bring your children here .,
bY4zTsHpJSNh1GIEv0E1Lg,1,So dirty !,
bY4zTsHpJSNh1GIEv0E1Lg,1,The food is gross and the people that work here are covered with food and stains on their clothes and they are so unfriendly.,
bY4zTsHpJSNh1GIEv0E1Lg,1,The salad bar is horrendous! .,
bY4zTsHpJSNh1GIEv0E1Lg,1,Can't say enough about how awful this place is !!,
fRWWzn1Nb_1NDitBp40G0Q,4,I called prior to my arrival to inquire about the weight and was told about 20 minutes.,
fRWWzn1Nb_1NDitBp40G0Q,4,I arrived ten minutes later to be told it's still 20 minutes but after a few was immediately sat in the bar area since there was no one sitting at the bar.,
fRWWzn1Nb_1NDitBp40G0Q,4,The waiter was very cordial and he provided our initial drinks fairly quickly.,
fRWWzn1Nb_1NDitBp40G0Q,4,He came back several times because it took us a little longer to order.,
fRWWzn1Nb_1NDitBp40G0Q,4,Once the food was ordered we went and help yourself to the salad bar.,
fRWWzn1Nb_1NDitBp40G0Q,4,They are usually known for their salad bar and for the most part it was pretty decent but there were several things that they were out of an obviously were in no rush to replace since I or entire trip they didn't replace things like the signature croutons among other things.,
fRWWzn1Nb_1NDitBp40G0Q,4,What are food arrived we had one minor set back which I was able to get corrected.,
fRWWzn1Nb_1NDitBp40G0Q,4,My big issue was constantly having to tell the waiter to fill a bar drinks even after bringing stuff to the table and seeing the cups completely empty.,
fRWWzn1Nb_1NDitBp40G0Q,4,Yes that is a huge pet peeve for me to have to ask to have my drinks refilled since when they are in a completely observable area and are to the bottom empty it should be an expectation for them to be filled.,
fRWWzn1Nb_1NDitBp40G0Q,4,Several times I had to find him and let him know we needed something to drink.,
fRWWzn1Nb_1NDitBp40G0Q,4,Other than that the food was pretty decent and the visit was mostly uneventful.,
S0qyAt8AXw7AlCGvwuKJdA,4,Update from last review: Things were much better this time around.,
S0qyAt8AXw7AlCGvwuKJdA,4,The food tasted better though once again it was thrown on the plate with no real care.,
S0qyAt8AXw7AlCGvwuKJdA,4,To me presentation is what fuels my appetite....but I digress....,
S0qyAt8AXw7AlCGvwuKJdA,4,The BurgerPalace Relaxer was pretty good.,
S0qyAt8AXw7AlCGvwuKJdA,4,The salad bar once again saved the day.,
S0qyAt8AXw7AlCGvwuKJdA,4,Steak was prepared as asked.,
S0qyAt8AXw7AlCGvwuKJdA,4,Our server was visibly overworked but she was very nice and attentive regardless.,
S0qyAt8AXw7AlCGvwuKJdA,4,Overall I'm pleased,
_ilvjw1vpES2abSFl9BEDg,1,This was probably the dirtiest restaurant I've been to in a loooong time.,
_ilvjw1vpES2abSFl9BEDg,1,Someone had a period mess all over the bathroom and it made me want to RUN but we had already ordered.,
_ilvjw1vpES2abSFl9BEDg,1,The salad bar sounded good but was out of plates and also out of almost everything ....not well stocked.,
_ilvjw1vpES2abSFl9BEDg,1,Standing in line at the salad bar there was a sticky invisible mess on the carpet.,
_ilvjw1vpES2abSFl9BEDg,1,It was disgusting.,
_ilvjw1vpES2abSFl9BEDg,1,They need a health inspector and a deep cleaning.,
_ilvjw1vpES2abSFl9BEDg,1,If they can't then they need to close up shop for a while to reset or just throw in the towel.,
BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,This just may have been our worst restaurant experience ever.,
BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,"To start, the first worker we encountered ignored us as we walked in, walked past us multiple times without saying a word to us and left us waiting at the door to be seated for about 5 minutes in a mostly empty restaurant.",
BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,Another waitress came over and sat us at our table.,
BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,"The table was sticky and dirty, high chair had food crusted on it and broken snaps and the booth seat was collapsed.",
BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,"Against our better judgement, we ordered the salad bar with our food.",
BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,"It was under stocked, not fresh and what was had the tongs/spoons laying in the food, handle and all.",
BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,"They seemed understaffed and our young waitress was juggling multiple tables and greeting guests, it took a little time to get her attention for silverware.",
BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,"About 10 minutes after ordering, we heard the kitchen call order up.",
BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,"The middle aged waitress went to the kitchen, came out looking at us and then just stood there not taking out food to anyone.",
BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,"After quite a bit of time, our food was brought out cold, mushy and absolutely disgusting.",
BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,The bbq nachos was topped with what looked like American cheese sliced that cooled into a plastic like texture.,
BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,The chicken was puverized into a sauce that looked like vomit.,
BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,"My husband's Philly cheesesteak hoagie was cooked on a dirty griddle, we both spit out our first bite and it was covered in burnt black speckles.",
BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,The bathrooms were the worst ever encountered in a restaurant.,
BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,"The women's had poop smeared on one of the seats, the other yellow drips down the side.",
BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,Piss on the floor and toilet paper strewn about - it is clear it had not been cleaned in many business days.,
BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,"Customer service, poor.",
BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,"Food, disgusting.",
BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,"Establishment, a disaster.",
BPNhUfpBBj2UJLMLSVERhQ,1,I've been to many BurgerPalace - this is an embarrassment to the brand.,
Kiyr9wX_AAxJKGs2gSPg3w,1,The food was horrible tonight.,
Kiyr9wX_AAxJKGs2gSPg3w,1,,
Kiyr9wX_AAxJKGs2gSPg3w,1,Got 2 sirloins.,
Kiyr9wX_AAxJKGs2gSPg3w,1,One was to have been cook medium and was well done.,
Kiyr9wX_AAxJKGs2gSPg3w,1,The other was to have been well done and was charred on the outside and raw inside.,
Kiyr9wX_AAxJKGs2gSPg3w,1,The kids chicken tenders were left in the fryer 2 minutes too long.,
Kiyr9wX_AAxJKGs2gSPg3w,1,Salad bar was good except the ice berg lettuce was brown on edges.,
Kiyr9wX_AAxJKGs2gSPg3w,1,Waitress was at our table 3 times without removing empty salad plates.,
Kiyr9wX_AAxJKGs2gSPg3w,1,Would not recommend.,
Kiyr9wX_AAxJKGs2gSPg3w,1,,
Kiyr9wX_AAxJKGs2gSPg3w,1,Guess that was why there was no waiting in a Saturday night.,
Kiyr9wX_AAxJKGs2gSPg3w,1,Lesson learned.,
#NAME?,2,We stopped here on the way back from vacation.,
#NAME?,2,Thought a fresh salad bar sounded good.,
#NAME?,2,This was by far one of the dirtiest restaurants I have been in for a long time.,
#NAME?,2,"The salad bar was not fresh, but it was stocked.",
#NAME?,2,There was a film over some of the food showing it hadn't been stirred or changed in a while.,
#NAME?,2,The waitress did not refrain from telling us they were short staffed.,
#NAME?,2,Half way through the dinner she said she had enough and locked the door around 8:30.,
#NAME?,2,I took my son to the restroom and was disturbed by the amount of urine caked in the urinal and unknown substance all over counter.,
#NAME?,2,It was quite concerning about the cleanliness of the kitchen.,
#NAME?,2,I posted a picture of a no ice sign.,
#NAME?,2,I am trying to wrap my head around this.,
#NAME?,2,Since McDonald's across the lot has bags of ice for $1 and my drinks were served with ice.,
#NAME?,2,Do they not have an ice machine?,
#NAME?,2,And this was the only restaurant with a sign on it.,
KDlFTqApQTM7CgnGSq-8mQ,1,The food took around 35 minutes to come out with almost no one else in the restaurant and with the wrong toppings and sides we ordered the Philly Cheesesteak and the sauce looked like it was left out for a week and was not appetizing at all would NOT recommend!!!,
4m9QaleMWTti3AULp5ceKw,3,"Had chicken tender dinner tonite, tasted vaguely like shrimp.",
4m9QaleMWTti3AULp5ceKw,3,I think they probably cook the shrimp and chicken in the same oil.,
ypzjA7DzeIdN2vt2WItOVA,2,Went in after running into the Edinburg outlet mall.,
ypzjA7DzeIdN2vt2WItOVA,2,We were pretty hungry so I went in to see the seating and there was plenty of seating available.,
ypzjA7DzeIdN2vt2WItOVA,2,We were greeted by a waitress who was pretty nice.,
ypzjA7DzeIdN2vt2WItOVA,2,We finally sat down and started to look around and no one had masks on per mandate and the posting on the business door.,
ypzjA7DzeIdN2vt2WItOVA,2,The waitress that greeted us didn't have her mask on appropriately leaving out her nose.,
ypzjA7DzeIdN2vt2WItOVA,2,The kitchen staff had no mask on at all.,
ypzjA7DzeIdN2vt2WItOVA,2,We left.,
ypzjA7DzeIdN2vt2WItOVA,2,Time to go.,
ypzjA7DzeIdN2vt2WItOVA,2,The additional star was that we were greeted immediately.,
kaZt28x80GzNoczjovFbig,3,The chips were really stale and water tastes like bleach.,
kaZt28x80GzNoczjovFbig,3,"Found a hair in my drink, and the restroom sewage system is very loud and obnoxious.",
kaZt28x80GzNoczjovFbig,3,Dirty plates and dirty silverware.,
kaZt28x80GzNoczjovFbig,3,"The waitress was very nice and helpful, best one I have had in a while.",
kaZt28x80GzNoczjovFbig,3,Best part about the whole lunch was the pineapple upside down cake.,
IOiIsN_cWWegQtlv4AKz0Q,1,I work at the mall next to this location.,
IOiIsN_cWWegQtlv4AKz0Q,1,I thought the salad bar to go would be a nice lunch.,
IOiIsN_cWWegQtlv4AKz0Q,1,I purchased the soup and salad bar to go.,
IOiIsN_cWWegQtlv4AKz0Q,1,"After paying, I was give my box for the salad bar.",
IOiIsN_cWWegQtlv4AKz0Q,1,"I walk over I there was no lettuce, and half the toppings were empty.",
IOiIsN_cWWegQtlv4AKz0Q,1,I paid almost $15 for this.,
IOiIsN_cWWegQtlv4AKz0Q,1,"$17 with a tip6 waitresses were working, less then 10 tables were occupied.",
IOiIsN_cWWegQtlv4AKz0Q,1,One of the customers I heard asking to see a manager.,
IOiIsN_cWWegQtlv4AKz0Q,1,I heard one waitress asking were a plate was because her table had be waiting 39mins!,
IOiIsN_cWWegQtlv4AKz0Q,1,Holy moly,
IOiIsN_cWWegQtlv4AKz0Q,1,.,
IOiIsN_cWWegQtlv4AKz0Q,1,This place is definitely Not manned by motivated individuals.,
IOiIsN_cWWegQtlv4AKz0Q,1,I will not recommend any of my customers to have lunch at this location.,
aGGKb37mbjsMceK5q1MIeQ,4,Delicious garden salad buffet makes a lovely Saturday afternoon break for lunch while shopping the outlet mall.,
aGGKb37mbjsMceK5q1MIeQ,4,"Must try the mango ice tea, yummy.",
bvxnygqSPWfS2StOmTLRJw,3,"So the food is good, really good.",
bvxnygqSPWfS2StOmTLRJw,3,The service that's where it gets bad.,
bvxnygqSPWfS2StOmTLRJw,3,The dude who took my wife and I order was something else.,
bvxnygqSPWfS2StOmTLRJw,3,He came out like twice while we were there.,
bvxnygqSPWfS2StOmTLRJw,3,Slacked in the drink department.,
bvxnygqSPWfS2StOmTLRJw,3,Our total was 50.66 we gave him 3 20s and he asked if we wanted change.,
bvxnygqSPWfS2StOmTLRJw,3,Don't ask that wow lol.,
bvxnygqSPWfS2StOmTLRJw,3,Then comes back comes back 9 ones.,
bvxnygqSPWfS2StOmTLRJw,3,I know it's 44 cent but he pocketed without saying a word.,
bvxnygqSPWfS2StOmTLRJw,3,Also when we got the boxes and stuff he was standing over us waiting for us to pack them.,
bvxnygqSPWfS2StOmTLRJw,3,Faking doing things on his handheld thing.,
1c5oq5h7u5J0MQmJkhg2GQ,3,Was very pleased with the gluten free Alpine Burger.,
1c5oq5h7u5J0MQmJkhg2GQ,3,"To get a good tasting gluten free bun is so hard and it was AMAZING, and cooked Medium rare to make me happy.",
1c5oq5h7u5J0MQmJkhg2GQ,3,I truly enjoyed my food.,
1c5oq5h7u5J0MQmJkhg2GQ,3,The service was not so good and the manager was rude.,
1c5oq5h7u5J0MQmJkhg2GQ,3,Because she didn't want to deal with me she comp'd our entire meal which wasn't necessary (the meal they forgot to bring was though).,
1c5oq5h7u5J0MQmJkhg2GQ,3,"Place wasn't busy, we did have a large party (a team) but we weren't hard to serve, this should have been easier to handle!",
1c5oq5h7u5J0MQmJkhg2GQ,3,Will go back to BurgerPalace just not to this location or with a large party!,
1c5oq5h7u5J0MQmJkhg2GQ,3,Happy I have leftovers though!,
7Er4HbVH_2KNYfCr4_zfqg,2,I do not eat much neither does my older mother so we usually share a meal.,
7Er4HbVH_2KNYfCr4_zfqg,2,But BurgerPalace has this special running 2 for $22.,
7Er4HbVH_2KNYfCr4_zfqg,2,So we decided to try it.,
7Er4HbVH_2KNYfCr4_zfqg,2,Well when the bill came there was an added $12 to the bill that was unknown to us.,
7Er4HbVH_2KNYfCr4_zfqg,2,When asked it was additional charges.,
7Er4HbVH_2KNYfCr4_zfqg,2,Apparently not everything advertised as 3 for $22 is it's actually 2 for $34 when the bill comes so be aware pricing is not what it's advertised and no one will tell you!,
7Er4HbVH_2KNYfCr4_zfqg,2,The food was good and the waitress nice but we would not have ordered those meals if we were not deceived on pricing.,
5UHHowxufAOwsf_aoK5hGw,1,"The quality of this particular BurgerPalace has gone from bad to worse, , today we came in and was told the wait would be 15 to 20 minutes due to a large party of 15 as they had reservations, but to wait when half the restaurant had vacant tables.",
5UHHowxufAOwsf_aoK5hGw,1,If we waited the service would have been so bad because all the attention with a small Staff would have been a two hour meal .,
5UHHowxufAOwsf_aoK5hGw,1,"The chef was on his cell phone, and some servers were just standing doing nothing.",
5UHHowxufAOwsf_aoK5hGw,1,Total unorganized management.,
5UHHowxufAOwsf_aoK5hGw,1,Someone needs to be fired .,
5UHHowxufAOwsf_aoK5hGw,1,"If you can't handle a party of 15 , you need to close down .",
5UHHowxufAOwsf_aoK5hGw,1,We went to the Villages location and was seated immediately.,
H7S0qV9j9rP336-11qIR1w,1,If I could leave less than one star I would.,
H7S0qV9j9rP336-11qIR1w,1,"I ate in the bar area one night and waited and waited and the Bartender refused to take my order, I guess it wasn't HER job.",
H7S0qV9j9rP336-11qIR1w,1,So I got up and went to the BurgerPalace in the Villages and Always get great service there,
0VWkrlmP3mJf2Ed-rWLIqQ,2,"I placed a take-out order for a plain hamburger with no cheese, cooked medium.",
0VWkrlmP3mJf2Ed-rWLIqQ,2,"I got a cheeseburger, cooked rare.",
0VWkrlmP3mJf2Ed-rWLIqQ,2,Wha??,
hrRZpOA-kHroSeEmzvnbXQ,4,"Ordered delivery food, a steak with mashed potatoes and salad.",
hrRZpOA-kHroSeEmzvnbXQ,4,The mashed and salad were only average but OK.,
hrRZpOA-kHroSeEmzvnbXQ,4,But the steak was excellent.,
hrRZpOA-kHroSeEmzvnbXQ,4,"It was only a sirloin, not an expensive cut, but it was perfectly prepared, truly rare just as I'd ordered it, and very tender.",
hrRZpOA-kHroSeEmzvnbXQ,4,I was really in the mood for a steak and I was so glad to get a good one.,
hrRZpOA-kHroSeEmzvnbXQ,4,"Also, I was pleased at the way it looked.",
hrRZpOA-kHroSeEmzvnbXQ,4,"Sometimes cooks will just throw delivery food into the takeout containers, but tho not fancy this was neat and nicely presented.",
hrRZpOA-kHroSeEmzvnbXQ,4,"All in all, very satisfied and glad I decided to order from them.",
hrRZpOA-kHroSeEmzvnbXQ,4,I will definitely order again.,
hrRZpOA-kHroSeEmzvnbXQ,4,,
hrRZpOA-kHroSeEmzvnbXQ,4,"Thanks, guys.",
PQDveb2XMd6aTTFCb6wOtQ,3,"Had low expectations at this place that borders a dying shopping mall, but we were traveling and hungry.",
PQDveb2XMd6aTTFCb6wOtQ,3,The salad bar is the thing at BurgerPalace but don't confuse that with cheap.,
PQDveb2XMd6aTTFCb6wOtQ,3,"I got the tilapia, which is often tasty at mid-range chain restaurants, and it didn't disappoint, but the parmesan cream sauce drowned the flavor.",
PQDveb2XMd6aTTFCb6wOtQ,3,"My hubby got the crispy chicken sandwich, and said it was OK.",
PQDveb2XMd6aTTFCb6wOtQ,3,What's a crying shame is that an average lunch cost $44 and change.,
PNqH2HCuZmJKlPGYZmxfhg,1,"Food was over salted, small portions for price!",
PNqH2HCuZmJKlPGYZmxfhg,1,Everything was poor except the server.,
PNqH2HCuZmJKlPGYZmxfhg,1,Won't be going there again.,
PNqH2HCuZmJKlPGYZmxfhg,1,Not at all what it used to be!,
LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1,"I reviewed this restaurant about a year ago, and it was two stars. Several weeks ago, my wife and I decided to try it again.",
LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1,"This time, one star and I doubt we will ever return.",
LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1,"First, I would like to say the young lady that was our waitress was as good as any we've had anywhere.",
LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1,"That's your single star, BurgerPalace bad: YOU NEED A TRAINED MANAGER!",
LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1,This location had a bunch of young kids hanging around the entrance to greet and seat you.,
LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1,Too bad they had no instructions as to how to do their job. One of them was also cleaning tables.,
LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1,"Too bad no one trained him to get all the slop off the tables: yes, my side of the table was not wiped cleaned.",
LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1,Opening the napkin wrapped silverware show a fork that was not clean.,
LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1,We had burgers.,
LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1,My wife's was as she ordered.,
LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1,"Mine was great, but only as a shoe sole!",
LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1,Grossly overcooked.,
LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1,Why does this chain think they can operate without a trained manager?,
LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1,"Why do they think they need 4 or 5 high school kids milling around, where 2 trained people could the job.",
LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1,"I forgot to add how the restrooms could use attention, again, where's the manager.",
LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1,"As this seems to be the constant condition of this restaurant, the chain must feel this is acceptable.",
LsJ-2Ju2LvNX8xH45kBxWg,1,Maybe they should hire a few secret diners to visit their restaurants at random times?,
7pqm4GW0P5yX-wNl9K0-ag,1,"Health Inspector, are you listening?",
7pqm4GW0P5yX-wNl9K0-ag,1,This place is downright disgusting.,
7pqm4GW0P5yX-wNl9K0-ag,1,It just feels dirty when you walk in.,
7pqm4GW0P5yX-wNl9K0-ag,1,"There were flies everywhere, including all over the buffet.",
7pqm4GW0P5yX-wNl9K0-ag,1,The bathrooms clearly haven't been cleaned in a while.,
7pqm4GW0P5yX-wNl9K0-ag,1,"Slow, lazy staff.",
7pqm4GW0P5yX-wNl9K0-ag,1,"Food was dried out, minuscule portions, and just badly presented.",
7pqm4GW0P5yX-wNl9K0-ag,1,"We had no silverware, our drinks got refilled, never took dirty plates off the table.",
7pqm4GW0P5yX-wNl9K0-ag,1,Server only showed up to collect her tip.,
7pqm4GW0P5yX-wNl9K0-ag,1,"If a group of 20-somethings who never worked a job in their lives before decided to open a restaurant on a whim one day, this is what I imagine it would be like.",
7pqm4GW0P5yX-wNl9K0-ag,1,There are so many other great restaurants nearby.,
7pqm4GW0P5yX-wNl9K0-ag,1,I can't imagine this one will be in business much longer.,
1idpNyydPbsSfVDiPCDmbA,1,Would love to leave a good review but of course I didn't get most of my order again.,
1idpNyydPbsSfVDiPCDmbA,1,"I'm usually missing at least one thing but today my order came and I was missing a cheeseburger, grilled zucchini, and 2 kids drinks.",
1idpNyydPbsSfVDiPCDmbA,1,Had delivered through DoorDash.,
1idpNyydPbsSfVDiPCDmbA,1,So I didn't get to have dinner and the kids didn't get their drinks,
MAnlwqzhAEGiwIR6B0GpTg,2,"Ordered the chicken fresco and shrimp fajitas, added 2 salad bars.",
MAnlwqzhAEGiwIR6B0GpTg,2,"No drink refills offered and out food took an hur even though there was only 3 tables in the sectiin,6 tables in the whole place.",
MAnlwqzhAEGiwIR6B0GpTg,2,Waiter was friendly but the kitchen was super slow.,
MAnlwqzhAEGiwIR6B0GpTg,2,Food was average at best and we were given some excuse about shrimp taking a long time to cook.,
QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,The food isn't that great.,
QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,I've been to one other BurgerPalace in Harrisburg that I wasn't impressed with and this one followed suit.,
QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,I had the cheddar broccoli soup and the broccoli was half raw.,
QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,Needed cooked longer.,
QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,I can handle al dente to a point but spare me crunchy vegetables in soup.,
QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,"Panera has them beat hands down with their broccoli cheddar soup, too bad there isn't one nearby.",
QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,The baked potato was ok but it takes a lot to screw up a baked potato.,
QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,The salad bar was very basic without much fanfare.,
QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,The smoked ham cut in little cubes was way too smokey tasting.,
QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,Overall the food deserved two stars but there is no way to break the rating down.,
QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,"The service was five stars, again, no way to break it down.",
QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,But in the end the place is only deserving of one star because you take your health into your own hands going inside.,
QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,We're in the middle of a pandemic.,
QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,Covid cases in Clearfield county continue to rise and so does the death toll.,
QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,"I realize this is DuBois Pennsylvania and the politics of the region play into the whole ""I have my rights"" dialog, and people do, but not when they interfere with my rights.",
QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,Why have a sign on the door of the restaurant saying masks are required when you are seating people who come in without wearing masks?,
QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,You don't even ask them to put one on.,
QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,"Add a sentence at the bottom off the sign that says ""NOTE: WE DO NOT ENFORCE THIS MASK RULE"" so that I can make an informed decision whether or not I want to expose myself to covid from people walking in past my table without wearing a mask.",
QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,This is not an outdoor restaurant.,
QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,I left before I could see if the people who were seated without masks went up to the salad bar not wearing them.,
QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,I don't have to really guess if they did or didn't.,
QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,"So if you feel you're immune from covid and are put off by wearing a mask then here's a place for you altho frankly, even without the pandemic, the food alone wouldn't have me coming back.",
QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,"But most importantly, if you're not going to enforce the rule you state on the entrance door then you need to either take the mask sign down all together or include a statement that you're not enforcing the rule so people like me have the option of turning around and going back to their car.",
QJgPXao4CLQVCi0uZWjzrw,1,That is not asking much.,
ZRE0uja6-E-k4ZouA2XvnQ,1,In Pennsylvania our bars are closed and one has to order a meal in order to consume alcohol.,
ZRE0uja6-E-k4ZouA2XvnQ,1,I guess this edict doesn't apply to BurgerPalace This past week a man stood at the bar with his mask around his chin ordering double shots of Jack Daniels.,
ZRE0uja6-E-k4ZouA2XvnQ,1,"He drank four double shots, and two other drinks and was coughing up a storm.",
ZRE0uja6-E-k4ZouA2XvnQ,1,"The bartender kept pouring, he kept drinking and coughing.",
VQNXma0uddb_hXcLnI3NQQ,2,"ok, i did give them two stars AND a recommendation but only because of the salad bar.",
VQNXma0uddb_hXcLnI3NQQ,2,the staff seems to be working hard to keep things afloat but the salad bar is not refilled and looks messy.,
VQNXma0uddb_hXcLnI3NQQ,2,"why did i say the salad was the reason for my recommendation , well it is a good salad if that's the meal you seek and it just takes me back to when the ruby was cool.",
K052Sde30Y_buqwTDWyBqA,5,We had to wait a good while for a table for 8.,
K052Sde30Y_buqwTDWyBqA,5,"However, the bar tender made a wonderful drink and I needed it.",
K052Sde30Y_buqwTDWyBqA,5,"If you ever go, ask for David as your server.",
K052Sde30Y_buqwTDWyBqA,5,He was awesome.,
K052Sde30Y_buqwTDWyBqA,5,"David turned our night around after a long wait, with his commentary, energy, and service to our large party.",
K052Sde30Y_buqwTDWyBqA,5,He made it a 10/10 dining experience.,
K052Sde30Y_buqwTDWyBqA,5,Thank you so much David!!!,
Okg4EBGdzRW-LOOQ2jRNGw,1,Ordered take out and absolutely ridiculous.,
Okg4EBGdzRW-LOOQ2jRNGw,1,Did not have Mac and Cheese as a side.,
Okg4EBGdzRW-LOOQ2jRNGw,1,One entree had the sides plus a side for a different entree.,
Okg4EBGdzRW-LOOQ2jRNGw,1,But the absolute worst was I ordered a Loaded Baked Potato and I got a cooked potato not cut no butter nothing.,
JhnJFUxcJ072S84yLqn5BA,1,Would not return.,
JhnJFUxcJ072S84yLqn5BA,1,Place looked overall dirty.,
JhnJFUxcJ072S84yLqn5BA,1,Table was sticky and the wall looked the same.,
JhnJFUxcJ072S84yLqn5BA,1,Salad bar looked like food poisoning.,
JhnJFUxcJ072S84yLqn5BA,1,I'd be surprised if the server wasn't high.,
JhnJFUxcJ072S84yLqn5BA,1,My first drink came in a dirty glass with salt questionably applied to the rim.,
JhnJFUxcJ072S84yLqn5BA,1,I'm not sure what the deal was with the second drink.,
JhnJFUxcJ072S84yLqn5BA,1,Was disgusting.,
JhnJFUxcJ072S84yLqn5BA,1,The food was OK.,
JhnJFUxcJ072S84yLqn5BA,1,"Only stopped here on the way to the airport, but wanting to share my experience with others.",
M91YWbCZA48L_LenSkxYGg,1,Wow.,
M91YWbCZA48L_LenSkxYGg,1,This is the first restaurant in Jackson that was HORRIBLE and I'm sorry we stopped.,
M91YWbCZA48L_LenSkxYGg,1,"Upon entering, the young hostess came to the podium with her mouth full and with an attitude.",
M91YWbCZA48L_LenSkxYGg,1,Okk.,
M91YWbCZA48L_LenSkxYGg,1,I asked her if she was ok and she said she was eating and working because they don't get breaks.,
M91YWbCZA48L_LenSkxYGg,1,"Again, should have left to go somewhere else, but we didn't because we were hungry.",
M91YWbCZA48L_LenSkxYGg,1,Gabby was our server- she was nice.,
M91YWbCZA48L_LenSkxYGg,1,We ordered 3 different things- 2 out of 3 were terrible.,
M91YWbCZA48L_LenSkxYGg,1,"We didn't let a Manager know because after getting turned down for a drink because they were closing... it was like, ""what's the point !""",
M91YWbCZA48L_LenSkxYGg,1,Yelp has their hours closing at 11pBut,
M91YWbCZA48L_LenSkxYGg,1,they actually close at 10.,
M91YWbCZA48L_LenSkxYGg,1,We had just received our food when the hostess asked if we wanted a to go box.,
M91YWbCZA48L_LenSkxYGg,1,So rude!,
M91YWbCZA48L_LenSkxYGg,1,I don't have anything positive to say because the food and service was not up to par.,
XNWyh5FyYUrfViE8zeu1Gw,1,Would not recommend.,
XNWyh5FyYUrfViE8zeu1Gw,1,Upon entering the salad bar looks like a buffet that wasn't cleaned up after a party...,
XNWyh5FyYUrfViE8zeu1Gw,1,my booth bench was dirty as was the window sill (like food particles & dirt!!) service was slow then when my drink came the cup was dirty.,
XNWyh5FyYUrfViE8zeu1Gw,1,Lastly they were out of fries & onion rings and when asked if I could add sweet potato fries at no extra cost (since they were out of fries & onion rings ) Iwas told they would have to charge me extra anyways.,
XNWyh5FyYUrfViE8zeu1Gw,1,We cancelled our food paid for my husbands beer & just ate at home.,
XNWyh5FyYUrfViE8zeu1Gw,1,So sad truly,
dnChIsmjuOpLkT6pPmgCkA,3,"Man, im actually disappointed today.",
dnChIsmjuOpLkT6pPmgCkA,3,So much so to take the time to leave a review .,
dnChIsmjuOpLkT6pPmgCkA,3,Normally ruby hits every time.,
dnChIsmjuOpLkT6pPmgCkA,3,I normally get the same thing but today i decided to try something different and to also use a food delivery app.,
dnChIsmjuOpLkT6pPmgCkA,3,NOTHING against the delivery person.,
dnChIsmjuOpLkT6pPmgCkA,3,So much so that the food came quick and hot.,
dnChIsmjuOpLkT6pPmgCkA,3,"The chicken today wasn't seasoned so much the sides tho, really the sides was the main inspo for the review.",
dnChIsmjuOpLkT6pPmgCkA,3,I ordered loaded baked potato and these folks sent me fries with that canned cheese on top cmon now ruby .,
dnChIsmjuOpLkT6pPmgCkA,3,Imma write this review but imma still fw yall tho,
P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,"If I could give 0 stars, I would.",
P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,"First, the server did not speak or tell her name (still don't know her name but if I did, I would tell you).",
P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,"When we ordered anything and said thank you, she would not reply.",
P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,Just rude for no reason.,
P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,"We placed our order, and she never came back.",
P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,"When she finally brought out the food, she didn't bring my sister's food and stated that they did not have the Alfredo for her pasta.",
P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,So I was like why bring out half the food and not tell us earlier that her meal was unavailable?,
P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,"So, my sister re-ordered after I had to run her down.",
P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,"I, also, asked for a manager.",
P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,No manager or re-ordered food ever came.,
P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,Keep in mind that I'm not eating my food until my sister's comes.,
P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,"I finally asked another waiter for the manager, and when he did come, he said that it wasn't that they didn't have Alfredo but that the order was put in wrong.",
P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,So the server lied.,
P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,He also tried to defend her as if she was so busy but the restaurant was not busy at all!!!,
P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,"Instead of owning the mistakes made, even when we told him how she never came back to check on us or refill drinks.",
P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,So by then my sister is mad and asked for our ticket for just the food we had.,
P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,"She didn't want the re-order, she just wanted to pay and leave because we were not out for free meals like he offered.",
P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,"I, myself, know the steps you take when you screw up on an order, since I had been a server for 8 years.",
P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,They still sent out the re-ordered in a Togo box by the 2nd server and brought me a Togo as well since I didn't eat without my sister's food.,
P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,"Our server and the manager never came back to our table to apologize or give us the check, so we left hungry minus the app we shared.",
P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,I know this restaurant will not miss our money but they will NOT see it or our serve again!!!!,
P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,"I felt like we were treated with no respect, as if we had did something wrong.",
P-6zuZ2T3PO67O_m-PwrYg,1,We were not rude in any shape or form but were treated as if we were the ones who acted as such!!,
e16GtmNbtUzhwIBNx5xJcA,1,Nobody is taking any pride in this establishment.,
e16GtmNbtUzhwIBNx5xJcA,1,The place was nearly empty.,
e16GtmNbtUzhwIBNx5xJcA,1,It was dirty.,
e16GtmNbtUzhwIBNx5xJcA,1,It looked like it could use a good deep cleaning.,
e16GtmNbtUzhwIBNx5xJcA,1,It was just dingy and drab.,
e16GtmNbtUzhwIBNx5xJcA,1,The plates on the salad bar were dirty and the broccoli had mold on it.,
e16GtmNbtUzhwIBNx5xJcA,1,Our food was food.,
e16GtmNbtUzhwIBNx5xJcA,1,That's all I can say.,
e16GtmNbtUzhwIBNx5xJcA,1,It wasn't great.,
e16GtmNbtUzhwIBNx5xJcA,1,I wouldn't even call it good.,
e16GtmNbtUzhwIBNx5xJcA,1,The manager was more interested in chatting with the waitresses than working.,
e16GtmNbtUzhwIBNx5xJcA,1,There were several employees there but Adrianna was the only one that was working.,
e16GtmNbtUzhwIBNx5xJcA,1,She was friendly and appeared to be hard working.,

ohYTS6gqWky4bDH5Je9XlQ,3,The garden bar was fresh and well stocked.,

ohYTS6gqWky4bDH5Je9XlQ,3,"I specified rare, and it came to the table so we'll-done that it was leathery, so I had to send it back.",

WfqSoeaTB9KFz0CYsDngHg,1,Don't know what has happened to this restaurant--possibly lack of willing workers.,
WfqSoeaTB9KFz0CYsDngHg,1,"Noticed a sign outside ""now hiring"".",
WfqSoeaTB9KFz0CYsDngHg,1,Service was extremely slow.,
WfqSoeaTB9KFz0CYsDngHg,1,We ordered salad bar and an appetizer with water to drink.,
WfqSoeaTB9KFz0CYsDngHg,1,Thankful for the salad bar because we waited ~30 minutes for the appetizer.,
WfqSoeaTB9KFz0CYsDngHg,1,We ordered it without scallions and it was covered so we had to send it back and waited another 10 minutes for it to come out cold.,
WfqSoeaTB9KFz0CYsDngHg,1,All very hard to eat while waiting for water refill.,
WfqSoeaTB9KFz0CYsDngHg,1,The waitress was nice and apologized saying she had to help in the kitchen.,
WfqSoeaTB9KFz0CYsDngHg,1,Sadly this may be what we have to look forward to from now on.,
IY35brciNBmPpAyfW02P4Q,1,A couple of weeks ago I placed a to go order and was told it would be ready in 20-25 minutes.,
IY35brciNBmPpAyfW02P4Q,1,We arrived 30Minutes later and had to wait 15 more minutes on our order to come out.,
IY35brciNBmPpAyfW02P4Q,1,Food was cold and employee seemed like it was a bother that we were picking up an order.,
IY35brciNBmPpAyfW02P4Q,1,I know people are human and it could be a one-off so I tried again tonight.,
IY35brciNBmPpAyfW02P4Q,1,"Placed an order (two entrees) 40Minutes ago and was told 10-25 mins (weird, but okay).",
IY35brciNBmPpAyfW02P4Q,1,Arrived at the 25 minute mark and am still sitting here waiting... when I called to check on it the girl said she would check and hung up on me.,
IY35brciNBmPpAyfW02P4Q,1,Finally 15 more minutes later they bring my food and again act like it is a nuisance someone placed and order..,
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,Second time eating at BurgerPalace in a long while.,
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,Our past few experiences were not at this particular Tullahoma location so I am not condemning this establishment for what another did.,
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,"With that being said, this one was probably the worst.",
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,We came in after my sons graduation ceremony.,
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,It was around 9:30pm when we strolled on in their doors.,
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,"While we had noticed many other restaurants were packed full, this BurgerPalace was no where close.",
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,(Hindsight is 20/20).,
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,We were quickly seated then told to wait to be seated because they had not yet wiped the table down.,
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,"After it had been cleaned, we sat and looked over our menu.",
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,"Our waitress got our drink orders and I asked if they seared their steaks-to which the waitress replied, ""I don't know, let me ask.""",
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,She came back and said no.,
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,"We then proceeded to order: Chicken Broccoli Pasta, Chicken Mac N Cheese, Ribs with Broccoli and Zucchini, Shrimp and Sausage Pasta, and some Chicken and Bacon something or another...",
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,"2 adults, 3 children-",
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,"So, my husband and 1st daughter received their plates first.",
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,"Afterwards, we received the cheese sticks my other daughter ordered as her appetizer, my son received his order second, mine third...",
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,yep.,
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,Nothing came out for my other daughter.,
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,The waitress said she was going to check on my second daughters food and would have it out directly...,
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,"Meanwhile, everyone is tasting their food...",
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,no one liked their food except for my son.,
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,"My shrimp and sausage meal order was drowned in a heavy grease substance, disgusting.",
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,It was not edible and I told the waitress just that.,
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,She asked if I would like anything else...,
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,I replied no.,
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,Everyone had nearly finished their food except my second daughter who had still not received her order.,
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,She disappeared and we waited and waited through refills and even asking for a box for my first daughters leftovers...,
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,Still no food for my second daughter.,
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,Finally we asked where her food was again- and was told she had only ordered cheese sticks.,
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,"Um, what?!",
P96yvxReyTnDVx1970fj9Q,1,Are you friggin' kidding me?,
rlZC_QYWLWKRdVilQFP2bA,1,I was with a party of 5 on New Years Day.,
rlZC_QYWLWKRdVilQFP2bA,1,It took an hour before we got any food at all and then it wasn't all ready at once.,
rlZC_QYWLWKRdVilQFP2bA,1,"2 peoples potatoes came several minutes later, as did the chicken strips.",
rlZC_QYWLWKRdVilQFP2bA,1,"One child's order of sliders came was slimy...don't know why, but then they remade them and they came out with a tiny sliver of cheddar cheese that wasn't melted.",
rlZC_QYWLWKRdVilQFP2bA,1,The burgers were way over cooked.,
rlZC_QYWLWKRdVilQFP2bA,1,One person ordered a medium well steak and it arrived rare.,
rlZC_QYWLWKRdVilQFP2bA,1,"With the employees scrambling around in the kitchen and close to it, it seemed as though they were without a cook and underlings were trying to get things out anyway.",
rlZC_QYWLWKRdVilQFP2bA,1,"If there was an actual phone number to complain to an owner I would, but it seems like they're not concerned with customer satisfaction, only making mines.",
rlZC_QYWLWKRdVilQFP2bA,1,Applebee's is across the street; I'll go there next time.,

JcGkFRYKDqVzb_etNVe8-A,1,PSA: Stay away from this location!,
JcGkFRYKDqVzb_etNVe8-A,1,The food was absolutely disgusting!,
JcGkFRYKDqVzb_etNVe8-A,1,"I'm genrally not one to write negative reviews, but this experience is in my top five worst ever.",
JcGkFRYKDqVzb_etNVe8-A,1,"For lunch today, I had the 6 oz sirloin, with a double order of grilled zucchini.",
JcGkFRYKDqVzb_etNVe8-A,1,"The steak was cooked as ordered, and was OK (at best), but the zucchini tasted really bad.",
JcGkFRYKDqVzb_etNVe8-A,1,"I also had the endless salad bar (which stopped at one bowl), the bell peppers were funky, as were the artichokes, and the spinach was wilted.",
JcGkFRYKDqVzb_etNVe8-A,1,"My coworkers had the mac and cheese and ribs, respectively, and neither finished.",
JcGkFRYKDqVzb_etNVe8-A,1,"They say hunger is the best spice, and we were hungry!",
JcGkFRYKDqVzb_etNVe8-A,1,"Unfortunately, we were all disgusted.",
JcGkFRYKDqVzb_etNVe8-A,1,"The ribs were clearly not cooked at the same time, one half of the rack was way overcooked.",
JcGkFRYKDqVzb_etNVe8-A,1,The Mac and Cheese went less than half eaten.,
JcGkFRYKDqVzb_etNVe8-A,1,"I wish, in retrospect, that I had some photos to share, because it didn't even look good.",
xO7YxfWUoeZcr8pvPqu1Uw,5,I've gotta give this place a five star rating.,

ytROt2YsBBQ7TDMON2pKLQ,1,"We asked that it be restocked, and they slowly did so, with tiny amounts of refills.",
ytROt2YsBBQ7TDMON2pKLQ,1,It was empty again within 10 minutes.,
ytROt2YsBBQ7TDMON2pKLQ,1,"Again, nobody restocked it.",
ytROt2YsBBQ7TDMON2pKLQ,1,My wife went to the ladies room and said it looked like no one had cleaned it in days.,
ytROt2YsBBQ7TDMON2pKLQ,1,"BurgerPalace used to be good, and I understand the issue with a lack of help, but there were two workers standing at the entrance greeting people. Perhaps they could have been more attentive.",
ytROt2YsBBQ7TDMON2pKLQ,1,We won't be going back.,
ytROt2YsBBQ7TDMON2pKLQ,1,Too bad.,
BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,This is the only BurgerPalace in the Rhode Island/Eastern Massachusetts area.,
BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,"Generally, we have been pleased with our past experiences at the BurgerPalaces we've dined at (including some that have closed.)This month",
BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,", on a pleasant evening, we decided to make a special trip to this Wrentham location for dinner, arriving a little before 7:00.",
BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,THEY WERE CLOSED!,
BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,"We had used the iPhone Maps app, which posts their closing time as 9:00.",
BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,"Then I checked Google, which also lists their closing time as 9:00.",
BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,"Then I checked Yelp, which has the closing time as 10:00!!BurgerPalace itself has posted on Yelp.",
BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,They know about their listing there!Three major sites that people rely upon for hours of operation,
BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,are all wrong!,
BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,"If only one was wrong, that would be bad enough, but ALL THREE are off by several hours!",
BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,"And CONTINUE to be!With gas at $5/gallon, we wasted money and time.",
BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,And our evening plans were ruined.,
BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,A word to the wise: DON'T GO TO THIS RUBY TUESDAY FOR DINNER.,
BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,You can't rely upon their posted hours.,
BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,"If a zero-star rating was possible, that's what we would give this BurgerPalace experience.",
BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,"By definition, food doesn't get worse than NO food, and service doesn't get worse than NO",
BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,serviceHopefully,
BINYBvmcUjPL17PvRWt6xQ,1,", all the hours of operations will be corrected soon, so others won't have the same aggravating experience.",

vBSKm34_3xti93Q3iBmoyw,1,Last Tuesday my girlfriend made a Reservation for the out side seating for this Friday and said we have small dog .,
vBSKm34_3xti93Q3iBmoyw,1,The person on the phone said dog are allowed and we have Reservations outside .,
vBSKm34_3xti93Q3iBmoyw,1,Today we went there for 3:30 we were told they don't do Reservations and they don't allow dogs event out side even though guy on phone said the allow dogs and said Reservations are all set.,
vBSKm34_3xti93Q3iBmoyw,1,THEY SHOULD train there employees on protocol and rules .,
vBSKm34_3xti93Q3iBmoyw,1,So don't wast your time there when there own Employees don't know the rules about town people certain information that is required.,
GGCn_t8mVfVXooCd7IwHbQ,2,We were a party of 11 and it was a friend bday.,
GGCn_t8mVfVXooCd7IwHbQ,2,Our food came out at different times and my food by the time it came out everyone was done eating (and I ordered the same food as 2 people at my table).,
GGCn_t8mVfVXooCd7IwHbQ,2,Other people who arrived after us got our food before us.,
GGCn_t8mVfVXooCd7IwHbQ,2,The manager gave us a discount and apologized which was appreciated.,
GGCn_t8mVfVXooCd7IwHbQ,2,Our waitress avoided us and didn't give us an explanation as to why the food was delayed.,
GGCn_t8mVfVXooCd7IwHbQ,2,It felt like as soon as she knew we were getting irritated she stopped trying because she barely came to our table.,
GGCn_t8mVfVXooCd7IwHbQ,2,As a result of her poor communication (the food late isn't her fault) it affected her tip.,
GGCn_t8mVfVXooCd7IwHbQ,2,I've worked in food for 10+ years.,
GGCn_t8mVfVXooCd7IwHbQ,2,You need to inform the customer and help them understand.,
GGCn_t8mVfVXooCd7IwHbQ,2,Turns out a bunch of late orders came in as soon as we sat down - that's why the food was late.,
GGCn_t8mVfVXooCd7IwHbQ,2,So the waitress definitely should have informed us.,
GGCn_t8mVfVXooCd7IwHbQ,2,She was young so maybe it was her first time...?,
GGCn_t8mVfVXooCd7IwHbQ,2,Idk but honestly we spend an hour and a half there and I'll never go again.,
GGCn_t8mVfVXooCd7IwHbQ,2,Kudos to the manager for owning up to it and giving us compensation.,
#NAME?,2,"When I walked in, waiters were not ready and had to wait when the restaurant was empty.",
#NAME?,2,They were out pizza and queso.,

#NAME?,2,Food was ok.,
#NAME?,2,Not very good overall,
gfvWCDwxcsY4iXAy5YXy0w,4,"I belong to their ""So Connected"" email club so from time to time I receive coupons via email for discounts and deals on the food here.",
gfvWCDwxcsY4iXAy5YXy0w,4,Well this past weekend I received a coupon for buy one meal get one half off so my mother and I made the trip to the restaurant to put the coupon to use.,
gfvWCDwxcsY4iXAy5YXy0w,4,We both got the hamburger meal and we both added the all-you-can-eat salad bar to our meals for a $5.99 upcharge.,
gfvWCDwxcsY4iXAy5YXy0w,4,"The salad bar is a meal in itself, always with lots of choices and fresh ingredients.",
gfvWCDwxcsY4iXAy5YXy0w,4,"I did notice this visit that the salad bar was missing both croutons and bacon bits, two of my favorite ingredients to a salad, so I was a bit disappointed but there were still plenty of other delicious ingredients to add to my salad so I was still pretty satisfied with the salad bar.",
gfvWCDwxcsY4iXAy5YXy0w,4,On my last two visits I have noticed items missing from the salad bar but I am wondering if the reason may be that because the restaurant closes rather early on Sundays (we usually get there around 4 PM and they close down at 6 PM) they might not replenish things that run out on the salad bar around that time of the day.,
gfvWCDwxcsY4iXAy5YXy0w,4,But of course that is just a theory.,
gfvWCDwxcsY4iXAy5YXy0w,4,We both enjoyed our meals and the salad bar as an add-on really hit the spot.,
gfvWCDwxcsY4iXAy5YXy0w,4,I noticed this time they have a new menu and they added some new items and took away others such as the hamburger sliders/salad bar combo which I used to order quite often (I hate to see that option go).,
gfvWCDwxcsY4iXAy5YXy0w,4,A lot of the items featured on the new menu are the same as before but I did see a few changes.,
gfvWCDwxcsY4iXAy5YXy0w,4,"Anyway, I am glad I got to visit the restaurant this weekend and I really did enjoy my meal!",
SylHywddSRipK8-B_PJpbA,1,We went today for lunch!,
SylHywddSRipK8-B_PJpbA,1,Our waitress was Myisha and she was terrible!,
SylHywddSRipK8-B_PJpbA,1,First we waited forever then I think she heard us complain so she finally came over and that was the last time we saw her until we got our check!,

SylHywddSRipK8-B_PJpbA,1,And gave everyone around us real silverware.,

SylHywddSRipK8-B_PJpbA,1,The steak should have been med rare but was well done!,
SylHywddSRipK8-B_PJpbA,1,Then my salad tasted like paper!,
SylHywddSRipK8-B_PJpbA,1,The ranch had no flavor!,
SylHywddSRipK8-B_PJpbA,1,,
SylHywddSRipK8-B_PJpbA,1,Needless to say... we won't be back!,
SylHywddSRipK8-B_PJpbA,1,It was really bad!,
SylHywddSRipK8-B_PJpbA,1,A waste of $30,

Al7-H0GiIk1dyulzyTbVPg,2,"The rib dish was okay, however.",
Al7-H0GiIk1dyulzyTbVPg,2,Now the service was lackluster at best.,
Al7-H0GiIk1dyulzyTbVPg,2,We had to keep flagging the server down and it took her almost 30 Minutes to acknowledge that our card had been on the table for us to pay.,
Al7-H0GiIk1dyulzyTbVPg,2,"2 tables came after us, ate, and paid before we were able to leave.",
DJVTczU2QG3pBsgZ41j9kg,1,We don't have a BurgerPalace where I amFrom so I convinced my husband for us to go out to dinner.,

DJVTczU2QG3pBsgZ41j9kg,1,We finally ended up getting a waitress but my husband ordered a beer in a bottle and I had to ask another server after 20 minutes for it.,
DJVTczU2QG3pBsgZ41j9kg,1,We saw our server 2 times.,
DJVTczU2QG3pBsgZ41j9kg,1,1 to take our order and one to hover over us with the check.,
DJVTczU2QG3pBsgZ41j9kg,1,I didn't want to tip much because it was awful and I wanted to speak to the manager but the server handed my husband the ticket then stood there and put him under pressure.,
DJVTczU2QG3pBsgZ41j9kg,1,I am not by any means trying to tell anyone how to do their job and we didn't act rude but it was the worst service I have ever had by far.,

7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1,"I told her at least take my plate off the bill, which they did.",
7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1,Then I asked to see the manager and was told he was very busy helping in the kitchen as they were short staffed today.,
7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1,I think that is the answer to my poor serving.,
7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1,"Also, since no one was actively supervising the staff, they felt free to wander around without their masks on.",
7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1,This was the worst experience I have had in a restaurant in years.,
7cEC3qLWzEf0Z4ZNllJJmA,1,"It is doubtful that I will eat there again unless all I want is their salad bar, which was very tasty.",

r-3ggTIkzIX0ohZRLWTZaA,1,"Food took 40 minutes, only one other couple sitting in the restaurant and they had already gotten food when we ordered.",
r-3ggTIkzIX0ohZRLWTZaA,1,We ordered 3 kids burgers with fry's and a grilled chicken sandwich (soggy bun) with tater tots.,
r-3ggTIkzIX0ohZRLWTZaA,1,Should'nt take 40 min.,
r-3ggTIkzIX0ohZRLWTZaA,1,"I got the salad bar, I got the last ""clean plate"" no good lettuce,",

r-3ggTIkzIX0ohZRLWTZaA,1,"It was so slow the staff were all sitting around the bar chatting, music was sooo loud I couldn't hear anyone talking around the table, she kindly turned it down after I asked, worst music selection ever, then it was turned back up 5 min later.",
r-3ggTIkzIX0ohZRLWTZaA,1,We will not be coming back.,
r-3ggTIkzIX0ohZRLWTZaA,1,Oh and the bathroom was disgusting!,
5TjLpJlDUUFZb5YUa9mMpQ,1,We were in Cadillac on Thursday and wanted to have a nice sit down lunch.,
5TjLpJlDUUFZb5YUa9mMpQ,1,We did get to sit down.,
5TjLpJlDUUFZb5YUa9mMpQ,1,We sat for over 15 min. before the waitress decided to come to our table.,
5TjLpJlDUUFZb5YUa9mMpQ,1,There were not many people but some of them we watched her visit 3 times before coming to take our drink order.,
5TjLpJlDUUFZb5YUa9mMpQ,1,"Order was not right and beware of ordering the mushrooms on your steak, they use it to hide the steak with more fat and gristle than meat.",
5TjLpJlDUUFZb5YUa9mMpQ,1,As we had been on the road several hours and were very hungry we ate what we could even though most of it was cold. We had to flag waitress down to get check so we could leave. I really wish the waitress would have taken the hair scrunchie off her wrist and tied up her long hair.,
VRoLD9J5NrvOaL8eF_ns9Q,1,We were driving back from Traverse City and wanted to sit down to eat.,
VRoLD9J5NrvOaL8eF_ns9Q,1,"As we walked in, there we tons of signs promising scan codes of menus and there was a table just to recruit new workers.",
VRoLD9J5NrvOaL8eF_ns9Q,1,"We were immediately seated with regular plastic menus and as we looked around, there was no one else dining in the restaurant.",
VRoLD9J5NrvOaL8eF_ns9Q,1,That should have been the first clue.,
VRoLD9J5NrvOaL8eF_ns9Q,1,"My husband ordered a Shiner Bock, but the waitress said they didn't have it, it wasn't on tap and had no clue what it was, although it was listed right there on the menu.",
VRoLD9J5NrvOaL8eF_ns9Q,1,The plastic menus were ripped an old... how would she not know?,
VRoLD9J5NrvOaL8eF_ns9Q,1,He finally settled on one of the five beers she did know: Sam Adams Summer Ale.,
VRoLD9J5NrvOaL8eF_ns9Q,1,"So, we ordered from an extremely pared down menu and she brought out my husband's beer.",
VRoLD9J5NrvOaL8eF_ns9Q,1,He took his first sip and it was flat and warm.,
VRoLD9J5NrvOaL8eF_ns9Q,1,There was barely any head on it and no moisture on the outside of the glass.,
VRoLD9J5NrvOaL8eF_ns9Q,1,"After going over their blah menu, dealing with their snippy and unknowledgeable waitress, then receiving a warm beer that was flat, we just left.",

Y6a_XNZRpnf-Y-K98tpC2A,1,"Very few cars in the lot, was expecting quick and quiet meal.",
Y6a_XNZRpnf-Y-K98tpC2A,1,"After standing at the front door for a few minutes, the hostess asked us to wait a minute to clean off a table.",
Y6a_XNZRpnf-Y-K98tpC2A,1,"There were very few patrons in the restaurant, not sure why another table wasn't ready and available.",
Y6a_XNZRpnf-Y-K98tpC2A,1,"After she walked away, she returned a few minutes later and said it would be 10-15 minutes before a table would be ready. A quick scan of the entire restaurant showed 5 tables in use, far far below any covid restrictions.",
Y6a_XNZRpnf-Y-K98tpC2A,1,,
Y6a_XNZRpnf-Y-K98tpC2A,1,When I asked why we couldn't sit at one of the other available tables she said that wasn't possible.,
Y6a_XNZRpnf-Y-K98tpC2A,1,I politely said I was not waiting and she said 'OK'.,
Y6a_XNZRpnf-Y-K98tpC2A,1,"Several of their restaurants have closed, its certainly not an easy business. Unfortunately one more example of the wrong person at the front door.",
lL8dyhtpajjFtk39o_RgOQ,2,"With the buy one get one special coupon in hand, I decided to give them another go.",
lL8dyhtpajjFtk39o_RgOQ,2,"Due to the rona, I used curbside pickup.",
lL8dyhtpajjFtk39o_RgOQ,2,"The curbside system when using a coupon could use some tweaking, such as being able to use the coupon with online ordering instead of requiring the order to be phoned in, and some way to make payment without personal contact.",
lL8dyhtpajjFtk39o_RgOQ,2,"Food wise, not much has changed.",
lL8dyhtpajjFtk39o_RgOQ,2,,
lL8dyhtpajjFtk39o_RgOQ,2,Ordered steaks/baked potato/salad.,
lL8dyhtpajjFtk39o_RgOQ,2,"The steaks, while cooked as ordered, were completely without flavor.",
lL8dyhtpajjFtk39o_RgOQ,2,No flavor.,
lL8dyhtpajjFtk39o_RgOQ,2,No seasoning.,
lL8dyhtpajjFtk39o_RgOQ,2,Zero flavor.,
lL8dyhtpajjFtk39o_RgOQ,2,How do you kill the flavor of a steak?,
lL8dyhtpajjFtk39o_RgOQ,2,"Even when effectively half price, I still felt somewhat cheated.",
lL8dyhtpajjFtk39o_RgOQ,2,"Maybe burgers are their thing, but it's not steaks.",
g8Z1nj1_Yatd7lmDD7vM5w,2,First time at this BurgerPalace,
g8Z1nj1_Yatd7lmDD7vM5w,2,All the staff were very friendly and the restaurant appeared to be clean.,
g8Z1nj1_Yatd7lmDD7vM5w,2,It wasn't too busy for it being a Saturday night.,
g8Z1nj1_Yatd7lmDD7vM5w,2,I observed the salad bar and it was pretty sad.,
g8Z1nj1_Yatd7lmDD7vM5w,2,A lot of stuff was pretty low and it didn't look like any of the staff were concerned about it.,
g8Z1nj1_Yatd7lmDD7vM5w,2,I ordered the grilled chicken salad and my guest had the 8 oz sirloin.,
g8Z1nj1_Yatd7lmDD7vM5w,2,Our waiter was at attentive and overly friendly.,
g8Z1nj1_Yatd7lmDD7vM5w,2,However after receiving our food the drink refills went down.,
g8Z1nj1_Yatd7lmDD7vM5w,2,I waited over 10 minutes before I got my water refilled.,
g8Z1nj1_Yatd7lmDD7vM5w,2,Nothing special about the food.,
g8Z1nj1_Yatd7lmDD7vM5w,2,The grilled chicken salad was $12 and to be honest Zaxby's has a bigger and more ingredients in their salads and it's $8.,
g8Z1nj1_Yatd7lmDD7vM5w,2,My guest said the steak was very chewy and was bland.,
g8Z1nj1_Yatd7lmDD7vM5w,2,Not impressed with this restaurant and won't be back.,
g8Z1nj1_Yatd7lmDD7vM5w,2,"Looking for a great salad, go to Zaxby's up the street.",
IQsdSEkO8-aPuWMcUy-mCg,1,"You would think a national brand BurgerPalace would be concerned about food and customer service, guess not.",
IQsdSEkO8-aPuWMcUy-mCg,1,"Went for lunch ordered the special cheeseburger, restaurant maybe 50 % full, 37 minutes later the cheeseburger finally showed up. Thought this was a rather long wait so went back 2 weeks later with some friends and ordered the special, cheeseburger with extra tots.",
IQsdSEkO8-aPuWMcUy-mCg,1,35 minutes later and we finally started getting our food.,
IQsdSEkO8-aPuWMcUy-mCg,1,I will say RT makes a very good burger BUT 35 minutes is far to long. Mentioned the long wait to the manager and all we got was shrugged shoulders.,
IQsdSEkO8-aPuWMcUy-mCg,1,,
IQsdSEkO8-aPuWMcUy-mCg,1,"Went today for the salad bar special (no wait for a salad bar) another person order mac and cheese and a bowl of broccoli and 30 minutes went buy before her food came, RT was maybe 40% full.",
IQsdSEkO8-aPuWMcUy-mCg,1,Would have mentioned or should say compline to the manager but he was too busy socializing.,
IQsdSEkO8-aPuWMcUy-mCg,1,Since this is one of the few places in Lenoir to eat lunch other than McDonalds it's sad.,
IQsdSEkO8-aPuWMcUy-mCg,1,But I'll take my money elsewhere.,
IQsdSEkO8-aPuWMcUy-mCg,1,My best advice unless you have a good hour or more eat anywhere else but here.,
1GAhn55wasZ7KRAPKbbrzA,5,We have recently started visiting BurgerPalace near Health Park in Ft. Myers.,
1GAhn55wasZ7KRAPKbbrzA,5,They have been offering great specials and you can't beat the prices.,
1GAhn55wasZ7KRAPKbbrzA,5,We normally have a drink or 2 and then order food to go.,

1GAhn55wasZ7KRAPKbbrzA,5,They have a great endless salad bar which is also reasonably priced.,
1GAhn55wasZ7KRAPKbbrzA,5,You can add it to your meal for a nominal fee.,
1GAhn55wasZ7KRAPKbbrzA,5,Check the specials before you go!,
1GAhn55wasZ7KRAPKbbrzA,5,"If you sit at the bar, I would recommend having Nate as your server!",

O-BK0SXQ2K1lwazJm3dqtg,3,Came in for my birthday burger.,
O-BK0SXQ2K1lwazJm3dqtg,3,I was hesitant based on my last two visits which were total disappointments.,

O-BK0SXQ2K1lwazJm3dqtg,3,The burger was cooked perfect and the tots were crispy.,
O-BK0SXQ2K1lwazJm3dqtg,3,"I took this order to go, as I live close by.",
O-BK0SXQ2K1lwazJm3dqtg,3,I might have given another star except they forgot to put the tomato I asked for on the burger.,
O-BK0SXQ2K1lwazJm3dqtg,3,Otherwise a decent experience.,
GI0oKoI9P8o2uBIQTh6zBA,1,This is the second time I've been cheated by BurgerPalace The first time I ordered delivery and received all the confirming numbers.,
GI0oKoI9P8o2uBIQTh6zBA,1,The order was 30 mins late and so I called.,
GI0oKoI9P8o2uBIQTh6zBA,1,They had just received the order which was placed and confirmed more than an hour earlier.,
GI0oKoI9P8o2uBIQTh6zBA,1,We're sorry there was a mix up and uber canceled the pick up because it wasn't ready.,
GI0oKoI9P8o2uBIQTh6zBA,1,I had to go pick up my order which was cold and I'd already tipped the driver.,

KYrguHbxxgo3aCLnZJf59w,5,"Salad bar was top shelf!

KYrguHbxxgo3aCLnZJf59w,5,you will understand)We,

gaR9C0v8Ud94DKAZnRGkqQ,2,Apparently the only way to get served is I'd you're a regular bar fly.,
gaR9C0v8Ud94DKAZnRGkqQ,2,3 people at the bar and one table.,
gaR9C0v8Ud94DKAZnRGkqQ,2,The bartender Christian refilled everyone else's drinks.. texted.,
gaR9C0v8Ud94DKAZnRGkqQ,2,Ate and still 15 minutes later not asked if i wanted to order. While I understand regulars have an established relationship with the staff... it's probably not the best to ignore local customers...,
gaR9C0v8Ud94DKAZnRGkqQ,2,that being said i will not return to this location and will recommend just about any where else at this point...,
gaR9C0v8Ud94DKAZnRGkqQ,2,i have consistently received poor service here and complaints fall on deaf ears,

VwgPxsINFnSnKjtqzGcrww,5,My day had just flown by no wonder...it was 8:30pm.,
VwgPxsINFnSnKjtqzGcrww,5,My goodness no wonder and with the 4th of July holiday many people were with their families.,

KEhXJJS6y7TDWebH1oo61g,2,The service was great.,
KEhXJJS6y7TDWebH1oo61g,2,My issue is that BurgerPalace changed their menu removing what used to be called a customer favorite and they replaced most menu items making them resemble Applebees and TGIF.,
KEhXJJS6y7TDWebH1oo61g,2,Why take away a fan favorite?,
KEhXJJS6y7TDWebH1oo61g,2,When asked if they could make it I was told that although the chef agreed and loved the dish too he didn't have the ingredients to make it for me.,
KEhXJJS6y7TDWebH1oo61g,2,It was Fresco chicken and it was amazing.,
KEhXJJS6y7TDWebH1oo61g,2,Please bring it back and I will continue to be the loyal customer ive been for 15 years.,

VE5t8TjDA0irr3eUqAQc6A,1,"we were seated immediately, the young lady took our order and when she brought us our sprite both cups had black dirty stuff floating in and on the cup, the cup had a waxy feeling, we explained it to her and she brought us another cup that was dirty as well,",
VE5t8TjDA0irr3eUqAQc6A,1,"we complained about the cup three times and just decided to not drink out of it, when she brought us our food my fries were undercooked and salty, my chicken sandwich had this crusted sauce on it that looked like curdled milk, it was blend and had no flavor whats so ever, my mom ordered a carbonara pasta and it was soupy, if I wanted to eat trash I would've ate my trash can at home for free.",

xpUZSeqT5c3FDEJlmiXMJg,1,"Again, I tried the Cheese Burger today sad to say it was burned on one side and dried out to the point it was uneatable, I ordered it medium....way overcooked.",

xpUZSeqT5c3FDEJlmiXMJg,1,The really sad thing is I went in to use the restroom and it was filthy (disgustingly dirty) looed like it has not been cleaned in a week or more.,

n2dlO6KxZUH9KFXZmrv1wQ,4,Went to BurgerPalace on 2/22/2022 .,
n2dlO6KxZUH9KFXZmrv1wQ,4,I ordered Shrimp Scampi and my companion ordered ribs.,
n2dlO6KxZUH9KFXZmrv1wQ,4,Our server was Monica.,
n2dlO6KxZUH9KFXZmrv1wQ,4,She was very attentive and helpful..,
n2dlO6KxZUH9KFXZmrv1wQ,4,If you go to 950 International Drive.,
n2dlO6KxZUH9KFXZmrv1wQ,4,Ask for her you won't be sorry.,
iFt1Fk7Urw9O_z1TOkGeRA,1,I was very disappointed in the Customer Service and Communication here!,
iFt1Fk7Urw9O_z1TOkGeRA,1,We called and ordered our food for carryout 30 minutes before we got to the restaurant.,
iFt1Fk7Urw9O_z1TOkGeRA,1,"When we got there, we walked to the bar area.",
iFt1Fk7Urw9O_z1TOkGeRA,1,The bartender tells us to go around the corner for pickup orders ....we get to the pickup window and no one is there,
iFt1Fk7Urw9O_z1TOkGeRA,1,....we wait 5 min and a young lady comes out the kitchen and asks for our order name....then she walks away and never talks to us again. She and the bartender walks back and forth serving customers while we are just standing there looking at others being served.,
iFt1Fk7Urw9O_z1TOkGeRA,1,"This is now approx. 50 min since we called the order in.....someone could have at least came to say our order is coming up, they forgot to make it, sorry for the inconvenience, or anything but instead we were just ignored by the numerous employees goin in and out of the kitchen.",
iFt1Fk7Urw9O_z1TOkGeRA,1,We eventually had to walk out and get food elsewhere.,
iFt1Fk7Urw9O_z1TOkGeRA,1,Such a shame because my frustration could have been tamed by a simple acknowledgement.,
iFt1Fk7Urw9O_z1TOkGeRA,1,Will not be going back.,
Xzv4XlukEKPK1KkBJTqA1Q,3,Best Salad Bar Ever.,
Xzv4XlukEKPK1KkBJTqA1Q,3,"Good Decent menu with appetizers, main entrees, deserts.",
M_NzeRcSqxvy75dn3iFN_g,5,"It's BurgerPalace Tuesday....but the service is great here, had a beer, ordered takeout, bartender was friendly!",
Bdx50dIaY5ceiYoLuajgjw,1,Just ordered a Cobb salad from this place and I have to say it's by far the worse food I've ever had in my culinary life.,
Bdx50dIaY5ceiYoLuajgjw,1,"Canned spoiled corn, canned diced tomatoes and bagged microwave bacon with a couple pieces of cardboard grilled chicken.",
Bdx50dIaY5ceiYoLuajgjw,1,I wasn't expecting much because let's be real it's BurgerPalace but this is beyond what's considered or passes for food.,
Bdx50dIaY5ceiYoLuajgjw,1,I'm probably going to throw up tonight after a couple bites of this and hopefully a club soda can settle my stomach!,
Bdx50dIaY5ceiYoLuajgjw,1,Good luck to you if you venture here.,
Bdx50dIaY5ceiYoLuajgjw,1,Staff seemed nice so maybe just stick to the bar!!,
Bdx50dIaY5ceiYoLuajgjw,1,Don't think they can ruin a bottled beer but hey stranger things have happened,

XFzTqoWiCnSmYSXaJi7SHQ,5,Ask for Katherine ... great at her job and has a terrific personality.,

7V_kLjaZQgyV4iwj4Sa_uA,5,"They also host live music every now and then, which is super fun.",

XYfQeYdWaPwtZMnAXWM_9g,5,"I absolutely love Ruby's, I was reading the reviews on how this place doesn't have 5 stars and most of the bad reviews are from 4-8+ years ago, it is amazingly cheap, the pizza is great, the people are kind, we get it a few times a week and we absolutely love it",
E14At1sUyBkH_mKa19HHmQ,5,This bar is amazing!!,

mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,It was late and my girlfriend and I needed.,
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,We came to BurgerPalace and saw a sign saying we needed to wait for a server to seat us.,
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,As we were waiting we watch an employee we assume is off the clock filling a ToGo box full of food from the salad bar.,
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,We figured she is off the clock and just trying to leave.,
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,,
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,Approximately 10 minutes go by until someone comes out and notices us and asks us to wait until she has found a section that was open.,
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,She found a small booth right next to a party of 9 people.,
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,The booth was still dirty so we had to wait for the worker to clean the booth.,
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,There was nobody else in the restaurant but it seemed important that we sit next to the party of 9...,
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,We sit down and Jennifer was our server.,
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,"We had come in an hour before close, but now it felt closer so we try to decide and order fast.",
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,My girlfriend orders coconut shrimp and the endless salad bar.,
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,Our server comes to take our order and right as my girlfriend orders the salad bar...,
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,The employee that we thought had clocked off and filled her box with food came out and started tearing the salad bar down.,
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,"She was still on the clock, she just didn't care that we were standing there waiting.",
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,My girlfriend speaks up a little bit louder and confirms that we could get the salad bar.,
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,Jennifer said that's not a problem.,
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,I also ordered the salad bar and the ribeye steak with the bourbon chicken mashed potatoes and broccoli.,
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,"Jennifer goes to grab our drinks, and tells us we can go start on the salad bar.",
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,"We stand up and see that there are no serving spoons, tongs, no plates, and the lettuce is gone.",
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,Jennifer comes back with our drinks and we ask if we can still get salad because there are no utensils.,
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,Jennifer goes back into the kitchen to confront the other worker and finally the other employee comes out with the plates...,
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,Slowly goes back into the kitchen and comes back out with the lettuce...,
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,Slowly goes back into the kitchen and brings out one spoon and sticks it in the ranch.,
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,She disappears into the kitchen and does not come back out.,
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,Jennifer comes to check on us and sees we haven't eaten yet.,
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,The girl had not brought the tongs and spoons so there was no way to serve ourselves.,
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,"Jennifer apologizes again, goes in the kitchen, grabs a bunch of utensils and asks us what we would like to have on the salad bar to be sure we can grab whatever we would like.",
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,My girlfriend and I grab two plates and fill the plates with whatever we can have because we know there was not going to be a second trip.,
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,Everything we eat from the salad bar tasted like it was soaked in ham juice.,
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,Our food comes.,
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,"The steak that I ate wasn't the best, but my girlfriend enjoyed my french fries.",
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,"We tipped Jennifer because we know how hard it is to be a server, but particularly a server who is covering for a lack of leadership.",
mgwWfnnoBZb_Y4s_SU7eRg,2,I do not think we will be going back there anytime soon.,
wbcHeN1hd1qKkcIoH9ZmHw,1,The waitress was good the chicken was burnt we could here the cook yelling and cussing at someone in the kitchen then the cook came out to tell us he was out of mashed potatoes but if we wanted them he could mash up some damn potatoes after he bakes them.,
wbcHeN1hd1qKkcIoH9ZmHw,1,Again the waitress was very good and polite.,
wbcHeN1hd1qKkcIoH9ZmHw,1,But would never go back.,
jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,My family and I visitation met for lunch here on Saturday.,
jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,There were 9 of us.,
jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,We arrived after 1 so the restaurant was not very busy.,
jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,It took a long time to get the waiters attention to get menus.,
jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,He gave us menus a and left.,

jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,We had find him and get his attention to get the 3 orders from the bar.,
jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,We only recieved 2 of the 3.,
jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,We could see drinks at the bar so we sent him back.,
jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,He grabbed the wrong one.,
jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,"When he bought out the meals, it was in 3 to 5 minute increments.",
jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,He forgot to submit two of the meals.,
jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,They didnt get their meals until everyone else was finished.,
jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,The food was average quality.,
jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,The salad bar was not well stocked.,
jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,Several empty or partially empty dishes.,
jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,No apologies from the waiter.,
jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,He was not trained well.,
jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,The forgotten meals were not comped nor was the screwed up drink orders.,
jqrz3NbUNCiyjeZlQCSfNw,1,We will not be back,
7EB8i8t-dITPos4Hb3jcUQ,1,This place was terrible.,
7EB8i8t-dITPos4Hb3jcUQ,1,it should probably shut down terrible.,
7EB8i8t-dITPos4Hb3jcUQ,1,Food was bad and the service was bad.,
7EB8i8t-dITPos4Hb3jcUQ,1,It use to be a nice place.,
7EB8i8t-dITPos4Hb3jcUQ,1,I'd rather eat at Mc. Donald's than this place.,
5WHK7qlpdPj3I940gLFZsg,4,Mac 'N Cheeseburger:,
5WHK7qlpdPj3I940gLFZsg,4,I've actually never been to a BurgerPalace before.,
5WHK7qlpdPj3I940gLFZsg,4,A couple weeks ago I saw an ad for this limited time item (while at the gym of all places) and was hooked.,
5WHK7qlpdPj3I940gLFZsg,4,"The cheeseburger is topped with enormous macaroni noodles, an exceptionally creamy cheese sauce, bacon bits, and I believe there was an actual slice of cheese on the beef patty.",
5WHK7qlpdPj3I940gLFZsg,4,"Another important note is the bun was soft, chewy, and was in proportion with the size of the patty (it sucks when the meat to bun ratio is off).",
5WHK7qlpdPj3I940gLFZsg,4,"I recommend picking up this item before it's gone, but it would be nice if it was made a permanent feature on the menu. Doughboy approved! (Doughboy_Food_Reviews)",
ic48vVW-DitCTIlbtYijmQ,2,Food probably 4 star but the service ruined our experience.,
ic48vVW-DitCTIlbtYijmQ,2,"Quick seating, pretty small place but clean.",
ic48vVW-DitCTIlbtYijmQ,2,"Took at least 10 mins to get helped, drinks came out quick and took our meal order, then poof disappeared for 45?",
ic48vVW-DitCTIlbtYijmQ,2,Mins till bill time.,
ic48vVW-DitCTIlbtYijmQ,2,"Kitchen staff delivered food and that's it, no checking on meal, drink refills, zero contact.",
ic48vVW-DitCTIlbtYijmQ,2,"Bourbon Salmon was nicely done, and the zucchini was cooked through properly, even the rice was good.",
ic48vVW-DitCTIlbtYijmQ,2,Burger was average but came with large order of fries.,
ic48vVW-DitCTIlbtYijmQ,2,No dessert because it was never offered.,
KXtM1NE2wRhy8OoZ7BsqsA,4,Came here to fulfill our salad craving.,
KXtM1NE2wRhy8OoZ7BsqsA,4,"The Good:The salad bar was stocked, clean and had lots of great options.",
KXtM1NE2wRhy8OoZ7BsqsA,4,Our server seemed new but did a terrific job as wellThe Bad:We ordered a drink for $2 and were charged $4.25.,
KXtM1NE2wRhy8OoZ7BsqsA,4,It took 10 minutes to figure it out and get our bill correctedThe,
KXtM1NE2wRhy8OoZ7BsqsA,4,Ugly Truth:,
KXtM1NE2wRhy8OoZ7BsqsA,4,"It was a nice location with great service, clean atmosphere and a yummy salad bar.",
KXtM1NE2wRhy8OoZ7BsqsA,4,We liked it here and will return for more when our cravings for salad get ot of control lol,
wMfiPuLNfZnys-shVLJq4A,2,I ordered a medium rare ribeye.,
wMfiPuLNfZnys-shVLJq4A,2,I should have known better.,
wMfiPuLNfZnys-shVLJq4A,2,I could tell the meat quality was poor so there was no use asking for a new steak when it came out medium well.,
wMfiPuLNfZnys-shVLJq4A,2,"My wife' said her sandwich was good, but chicken is chicken.",
wMfiPuLNfZnys-shVLJq4A,2,Restaurants should learn to only offer food they are good at making.,
G3cOWcr09k9osHpyEQ4TUQ,4,Since losing our BurgerPalace in Council Bluffs Iowa we decided to stop in and have our salad bar buffet.,
G3cOWcr09k9osHpyEQ4TUQ,4,It was a nice refreshing meal on an over 100 degree day.,
G3cOWcr09k9osHpyEQ4TUQ,4,"I am never disappointed in the options on the salad bar BUT today I'm not sure what it was but both myself and my husband got very sick to our stomachs directly after we ate, I actually got sick before we left.",
G3cOWcr09k9osHpyEQ4TUQ,4,We will still return in the future because maybe it was just a fluke.,
G3cOWcr09k9osHpyEQ4TUQ,4,Thank you for continuing the salad bar options when many other places have discontinued them..,
4dtFnEdydMgltAwviVMo7A,5,"There was this very nice young lady named Hannah when I walked in, she was a wonderful hostess and got us scheduled and right where we needed to be, she was a great smiling face to walk Into, the food was quite good, and the servers were fast, respectful, kind, and funny!",
4dtFnEdydMgltAwviVMo7A,5,Great experience!,
L2qIDZvtI1AqtT5aWlsy3A,4,Picked up a full rack of baby back ribs in Urbandale and it tasted great.,
L2qIDZvtI1AqtT5aWlsy3A,4,Recommend asking for extra sauce on the side.,
k-XI10hlhCUo1KGk5ij41g,3,It took close to 30 minutes to get our food and I continue to wait on the server to bring the bill.,
k-XI10hlhCUo1KGk5ij41g,3,"If the server was friendly, we probably wouldn't have been so frustrated.",
_LRBDvexP6SI2KtYeC8jSA,4,"The food has always been very good, at times excellent.",
_LRBDvexP6SI2KtYeC8jSA,4,"Servers tend to be knowledgeable and polite, and the venue is very pleasant.",
_LRBDvexP6SI2KtYeC8jSA,4,We go there several times a year.,
_LRBDvexP6SI2KtYeC8jSA,4,I would give 4.5 stars if I could.,
mmqAKHg-5ztP6sFtsB3FRQ,1,The food wasn't good... but what was most memorable was the General Manager.,
mmqAKHg-5ztP6sFtsB3FRQ,1,The GM was initially very friendly until my party requested another table away from two infants.,
mmqAKHg-5ztP6sFtsB3FRQ,1,The minor inconvenience of requesting a different table brought out a rudeness I haven't witnessed elsewhere.,
mmqAKHg-5ztP6sFtsB3FRQ,1,"After our meal was delivered, my party was able to witness the GM arguing very loudly with an upset customer on the phone.",
mmqAKHg-5ztP6sFtsB3FRQ,1,Evidently the GM thought their title and behavior was impressive as he projected his voice for the entire establishment to hear and reiterated his title.,
mmqAKHg-5ztP6sFtsB3FRQ,1,At the end of our meal I tipped the server extremely well and told him that his man-child of a boss was surely costing him tips at other tables and encouraged them to quit as they deserve to work for an adult.,
xldzwyZ9hbjq78vXgRN9Sw,1,This place sucks.,
xldzwyZ9hbjq78vXgRN9Sw,1,It's like an Applebee's but more expensive for shit food.,
xldzwyZ9hbjq78vXgRN9Sw,1,Didn't get a refill on my tea.,
xldzwyZ9hbjq78vXgRN9Sw,1,Nobody checks led on us.,
xldzwyZ9hbjq78vXgRN9Sw,1,Never going back.,
xldzwyZ9hbjq78vXgRN9Sw,1,Place is garbage.,
tiGwDMczIXuU_yXenlX43g,1,Doesn't pick up when you call to place an order.,
tiGwDMczIXuU_yXenlX43g,1,How do they stay in business?,
tiGwDMczIXuU_yXenlX43g,1,Ordering someplace else I guess.,
VObk8mYt-qwPBifCERSVlw,1,These people had the nerve to serve me raw fish and one sided cooked shrimp I ordered via GrubHub I called and spoke to somebody who claims they spoke to the manager who seem more concerned with me getting my money via GrubHub then them having a continued customer because they were getting ready to close I have never had a problem with my food before but I know I will never spend my $30 at this place again due to the terrible customer service.,
VObk8mYt-qwPBifCERSVlw,1,And even though they served me raw fish I just asked if I could just get my food remade - The lady over the phone replied who's going to bring it to you i'm not going to bring it to you ( keep in mind I never asked her to do so ) I replied I could pick up it up if it was remade she said no we are closed!,
VObk8mYt-qwPBifCERSVlw,1,-NEVER A FUCKING GAIN !,
0nCsTreEZI6u1PtCOa_gFA,5,Had a late dinner there.,
0nCsTreEZI6u1PtCOa_gFA,5,The staff was friendly and working hard.,

0nCsTreEZI6u1PtCOa_gFA,5,Will visit again.,
TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3,We came on a Wednesday to use a Buy One Get One coupon.,
TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3,The restaurant was very clean and not crowded so we were seated right away.,
TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3,Service was good overall as our waitress hustled as she was the only one on this dinner shift likely the result of the difficult times for restaurants to find help.,
TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3,I liked that the salad bar was open during the pandemic and masks and gloves were required at the salad bar (disposable gloves provided) which worked well.,
TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3,"Salad bar was decent, nothing remarkable or bad for that matter.",
TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3,Ranch dressing was watery.,
TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3,"I had a full rack Of ribs, wanted onion rings but they were out so had fries and zucchini.",
TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3,"The ribs were ""OK"" and what I expected.",
TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3,On the dry side but slathered with bbq sauce to compensate and meat easily came off the bone.,
TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3,Zucchini was excellent and piping hot fries were just ok - could have been hotter and less soggy.,
TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3,She had Asiago chicken which was super cheesy and good.,
TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3,Chicken was very tender and same sides I had.,
TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3,It was a decent meal and value (with 1 free entree) but at full price I may have been slightly dissatisfied.,
TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3,I wish you could substitute salad bar for a side with a $2 or $3 up-charge versus having to buy for $5 as we each had 1 not so big salad.,
TfgXJAxGdVNLK1Tc2Tr2ww,3,Overall we enjoyed the meal.,
qQ9NHH2R_I9v9DdnlO_JmA,1,Not open their published hours.,

1wLIieJD6luSTh7LDQNZog,3,"While staying in the area for a work project, there weren't very many options for food past 8PM.",
1wLIieJD6luSTh7LDQNZog,3,This BurgerPalace is located at a good spot and is walking distance from a couple of the hotels in the area.,
1wLIieJD6luSTh7LDQNZog,3,"The setup is just as you would expect- pick up area and bar on one side, sit-down tables on the other.",

1wLIieJD6luSTh7LDQNZog,3,The bartender on two nights was Matt and he certainly was a positive on my visits.,
1wLIieJD6luSTh7LDQNZog,3,Good attitude and a pleasure to be around.,
1wLIieJD6luSTh7LDQNZog,3,Although it was past 9PM he still had to clean and let those of us who were still eating finish our meals uninterrupted and didn't rush anyone out the door.,
pbo80LmyjNIcxCyhudORZA,1,Had food ordered and delivered at work.,
pbo80LmyjNIcxCyhudORZA,1,As soon as I started to take the first cut into my chicken I saw a black curly hair.,
pbo80LmyjNIcxCyhudORZA,1,When I called I spoke with Fay.,
pbo80LmyjNIcxCyhudORZA,1,She didn't even allow me to continue my sentence before apologizing and then proceeded to say they couldn't refund because it was through uber Eats.,
pbo80LmyjNIcxCyhudORZA,1,"Problem other than the hair is, I didn't ask for a refund.",
pbo80LmyjNIcxCyhudORZA,1,I was hungry and wanted the food that was ordered and paid for.,
pbo80LmyjNIcxCyhudORZA,1,She blew me off because she said I'd have to call Uber again and have them deliver.,
pbo80LmyjNIcxCyhudORZA,1,What type of customer service is that!?,
pbo80LmyjNIcxCyhudORZA,1,"She was completely rude, disrespectful and showed no real empathy at all.",
s0CsNWJbvDET4lfVOrYMNw,5,I'm not sure why this restaurant has been rated so poorly.,
s0CsNWJbvDET4lfVOrYMNw,5,"I'm rather picky, and we usually get BurgerPalace delivered once a week.",
s0CsNWJbvDET4lfVOrYMNw,5,"Their ribs are just-as-good-as Bear's, if not BETTER!",
s0CsNWJbvDET4lfVOrYMNw,5,Chicken strips and fried shrimp are delicious (last time I got their ribs-chicken & shrimp meal and was soooo happy. We have ordered the artichoke dip and tater tots a few times; always good.,
s0CsNWJbvDET4lfVOrYMNw,5,,
s0CsNWJbvDET4lfVOrYMNw,5,"I can't recommend their grilled zucchini enough; I usually choose it for both of my 2 sides, which makes my ribs a keto friendly meal.",
s0CsNWJbvDET4lfVOrYMNw,5,They're dinner salad is huge and fresh.,
s0CsNWJbvDET4lfVOrYMNw,5,I love their cheesecake!,
s0CsNWJbvDET4lfVOrYMNw,5,"I don't think they make it (it arrived half frozen last time), but it is amazing!",

xK2hRZmtuLNIvjwZKWBIEg,3,We were getting take-out salad bar from BurgerPalace sometimes as much as twice a week over the summer.,
xK2hRZmtuLNIvjwZKWBIEg,3,"if you join their email club you get a lot of great promos and deals and to be honest, we loved their salad bar!",
xK2hRZmtuLNIvjwZKWBIEg,3,We moved to CT from CA where we had MANY build your own salad restaurants and we miss that!,
xK2hRZmtuLNIvjwZKWBIEg,3,So finding BurgerPalace salad bar was a win for us.,
xK2hRZmtuLNIvjwZKWBIEg,3,"However, starting in the fall, we realized the quality of the salad bar items, how often they would refill (we could wait for 10-15 minutes after asking to get more lettuce because it was empty), and the fact that they would run out of items often (as early as 5PM on a weekday) really has discouraged us from returning.",
xK2hRZmtuLNIvjwZKWBIEg,3,We have tried to go back once or twice but it's been disappointing each time.,
s6CMbyNpuqgwLoVvwQpmqQ,3,The food here is decent but way too overpriced for what it's worth.,
s6CMbyNpuqgwLoVvwQpmqQ,3,I like the coconut shrimp and the chicken sandwich here but they are super greasy and dripping in oil.,
s6CMbyNpuqgwLoVvwQpmqQ,3,The peach sangria from here is yummy though and was much more affordable than the food here.,
s6CMbyNpuqgwLoVvwQpmqQ,3,This is definitely not the place to go if you're on a budget but it's okay if you're craving American food once in awhile.,

og3Ztw6-S_hgriv7vP0tmw,1,"Sadly, this used to be my favorite restaurant.",
og3Ztw6-S_hgriv7vP0tmw,1,"The last two visits though, have soured me to the restaurant.",
og3Ztw6-S_hgriv7vP0tmw,1,"Last week, eating in, our baked potatoes were slathered in sour cream, despite being ordered without and the to go order we placed with our dine in order was never sent to the kitchen.",
og3Ztw6-S_hgriv7vP0tmw,1,"Today, I called in an order.",
og3Ztw6-S_hgriv7vP0tmw,1,"Before ordering, gave the coupon code to the person answering the phone and asked a specific question about the order and based on the server's reply - placed my order.",
og3Ztw6-S_hgriv7vP0tmw,1,"When I arrived to pick it up, the bill was 16% higher than what it should have been.",
og3Ztw6-S_hgriv7vP0tmw,1,"When questioned, the manager on duty said, the coupon couldn't be used.",
og3Ztw6-S_hgriv7vP0tmw,1,She apologized and said there was nothing she could do.,
og3Ztw6-S_hgriv7vP0tmw,1,I explained that I asked specifically when I placed the order and she responded that the server should have asked her before saying yes.,
og3Ztw6-S_hgriv7vP0tmw,1,"I could have left the food, but not a fan of wasting, paid the higher price and left.",
og3Ztw6-S_hgriv7vP0tmw,1,Since when can a manager not make an order right?,
og3Ztw6-S_hgriv7vP0tmw,1,I guess you have to ask a manager when ordering because apparently the servers don't have the training - or support of their supervisors.,

5o-fmEjAwiuLHETxyrlqWQ,1,52 minutes to get pasta & a burger!,
5o-fmEjAwiuLHETxyrlqWQ,1,"The burger had a gooey, disintegrating bottom bun, and the side of fries portion looked like it was a toddler's meal.",
5o-fmEjAwiuLHETxyrlqWQ,1,"I asked for more fries, which were brought, but were room temperature.",
5o-fmEjAwiuLHETxyrlqWQ,1,"Needless to say, the fries weren't eaten.",
5o-fmEjAwiuLHETxyrlqWQ,1,"The manager heard me say we had been waiting almost an hour for our food (she had helped the waitress deliver our food), but no apology or discount was offered.",
5o-fmEjAwiuLHETxyrlqWQ,1,"By the way, none of the toilets in the women's bathroom flush properly.",
5o-fmEjAwiuLHETxyrlqWQ,1,"In an attempt to use one that didn't have ""stuff"" in it from a previous person, I looked at all of them, proceed to flush all of them and none of them flush everything done.",

ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,June 1 my friend and I went specifically to have the garden bar.,
ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,Unfortunately it was not available.,
ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,Several people walked in and back out for the same reason.,
ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,My friend asked to speak to the manager.,
ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,He came by And introduced himself.,
ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,He blamed lack of staff for not having the bar.,
ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,He was there to hire staff Only.,
ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,Supposedly he worded 19 hours.,
ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,I'm assuming he was wanting some sympathy but he was talking to two self employed women that have worked hard.,
ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,I think he could have come up with a solution to the problem.,
ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,"In nineteen hours he could have the lettuce cut up, veggies, But all we heard was blame to the staff.",
ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,If you are the manager wouldn't you offer customers a discount or something instead of letting them walk out.?,
ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,Why is there a turnover at the restaurant?,
ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,They are always hiring new staff.,
ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,Something isn't right Or they wouldn't quit.,
ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,Could it be the manager doesn't respect his staff!,
ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,He definitely isn't a team player or he would have done more instead of blaming the staff.,
ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,Brianna and Tamara are definitely team players.,
ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,They are great with customers and providing service.,
ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,They are the reasons I'm giving a few stars.,
ajJyJEnNJJrAkvwLbAU4Og,3,If it wasn't for them it would be zero stars.,
3D4FaCVfVBBhi-ZqcNauWg,2,"I went to the College Drive location in Suffolk, VA!",
3D4FaCVfVBBhi-ZqcNauWg,2,We have been to this location many times because my husband loves the salad bar.,
3D4FaCVfVBBhi-ZqcNauWg,2,We ordered to go this time 2 of the TEX MEX Steak Fajitas they have been advertising.,
3D4FaCVfVBBhi-ZqcNauWg,2,When I got home with my order 1) the picture advertised and what I received didn't even come close to the same!,
3D4FaCVfVBBhi-ZqcNauWg,2,2) the black beans and rice were left out of both entrees completely!,
3D4FaCVfVBBhi-ZqcNauWg,2,I normally check my order before I leave but the bag was tied so tight I didn't this time.,
3D4FaCVfVBBhi-ZqcNauWg,2,I made numerous attempts to call the restaurant and the phone was never answered!,
3D4FaCVfVBBhi-ZqcNauWg,2,I understand staffing is a problem in most restaurants currently so I made a 2nd trip back to the restaurant to pick up the omitted part of my order!,
3D4FaCVfVBBhi-ZqcNauWg,2,The amount of the 2 sides I received was not worth the $4.59 per gal. of gas it cost to make that 2nd trip!,
3D4FaCVfVBBhi-ZqcNauWg,2,My biggest regret was not taking a pic. of MY order to show a comparison to what was advertised for $12.99.,
3D4FaCVfVBBhi-ZqcNauWg,2,,
3D4FaCVfVBBhi-ZqcNauWg,2,Taco Bell would have been a better choice and much cheaper!,

dMjN_X3zUO-pzACMpzZmgQ,2,"To top it all off, it was a little pricey for what I got.",

RLASoakAoQ-M7JmwDCPq0A,4,I would've given 5 stars but I wasn't happy with the portion sizes. I could count how many zucchini's were on my plate and they probably did as well.,
RLASoakAoQ-M7JmwDCPq0A,4,For the price they should give a little more zucchini and mashed potatoes other than that the food overall was good.,
RLASoakAoQ-M7JmwDCPq0A,4,Mom enjoyed hers as well.,
RLASoakAoQ-M7JmwDCPq0A,4,Since COVID is still thriving and numbers are rising.,

9Hh3LZgceU4HPY1zGMZ4Mg,2,Service is not great.,
9Hh3LZgceU4HPY1zGMZ4Mg,2,Food was ok.,
9Hh3LZgceU4HPY1zGMZ4Mg,2,"Good for a quick meal, if staying at nearby hotel.",
DFEiMFE1LXntWO_S2Nj7qQ,1,I ordered a medium rare rib eye steak.,
DFEiMFE1LXntWO_S2Nj7qQ,1,The texture of the steak (which was over seasoned) was as if it was frozen then microwaved and put into the broiler to give it color.,
DFEiMFE1LXntWO_S2Nj7qQ,1,The broccoli was over salted but at least the mashed potatoes was eatable.,
DFEiMFE1LXntWO_S2Nj7qQ,1,The server was very nice but when she asked me how the steak was...it was as if she knew it wasn't very good.,
DFEiMFE1LXntWO_S2Nj7qQ,1,This is NOT the place to order a steak!,
x8tPH-FJWo1lji1-zNslvA,1,"Very sticky table, chair, everything I touched was sticky, over heard a host saying kaitlin didn't want to service us because she was busy and that she didn't want to be seated anymore,",
x8tPH-FJWo1lji1-zNslvA,1,But when we got here there was only maybe 3-5 different family's so it wasnt busy at all so I don't get the problem.,
x8tPH-FJWo1lji1-zNslvA,1,"The server behind the bar was very nice, now the food...",
x8tPH-FJWo1lji1-zNslvA,1,"I don't know what happened but you could tell the chicken wasn't washed or cooked well, it tasted funny, my broccoli was hard, the spaghetti was like eating rubber very chewy...",
x8tPH-FJWo1lji1-zNslvA,1,my stomach in so much pain after eating only 3 bites of this chicken and broccoli!!!!!,
4XJo0UeOoScWqYLDp6R0hA,1,BurgerPalace BurgerPalace on Emrick Blvd has the worst bartender.,
4XJo0UeOoScWqYLDp6R0hA,1,,
4XJo0UeOoScWqYLDp6R0hA,1,"She's arrogant, hate written all over her face and shows it thru her attitude.",
4XJo0UeOoScWqYLDp6R0hA,1,"She's bad for the the restaurant, unless you're caucasian tipping alot of money,then she's kissing your behind like a puppy",
4XJo0UeOoScWqYLDp6R0hA,1,"The restaurant needs to send her to school to learn how to speak to the customers and relate to clients,if not, their business would go down,and that would be ashame for a good restaurant because of 1 thorn in the midst.",
pscet6kkJ1xNhajZCV3Ymg,1,When you have to keep hunting down your waitress (Kaille) it is a good sign you should eat elsewhere.,
pscet6kkJ1xNhajZCV3Ymg,1,The food arrived cold and stale.,
pscet6kkJ1xNhajZCV3Ymg,1,"We ordered the burgers, which were promoted as improved (it is hard to imagine them being worse before).",
pscet6kkJ1xNhajZCV3Ymg,1,"The buns were dry and tasteless, the beef(?) was a congealed mystery, and the toppings needed to be scrapped off (I wouldn't feed a gerbil the lettuce).",
pscet6kkJ1xNhajZCV3Ymg,1,No refill on beverages was offered.,
pscet6kkJ1xNhajZCV3Ymg,1,"No measures were taken for Covid: the waitress was unmasked, there was a salad bar that everyone had open access to, no sanitizer to be found, the dishes/silverware/glasses all could have used a good washing, and there was no spacing of patrons (despite there only being a few).",
pscet6kkJ1xNhajZCV3Ymg,1,"Despite all this, being the holidays and with Covid, a standard tip was given the waitress; who when she saw it huffed off in a snit for not being given more.",
pscet6kkJ1xNhajZCV3Ymg,1,"A TGI Friday's is just down the road, consider going there or someplace else.",
Zqroe_hKmfu2gg_wv7Aw-w,2,I picked up takeout from this location.,
Zqroe_hKmfu2gg_wv7Aw-w,2,"I guess the kitchen accidentally made my order for dine-in instead of takeout so when I arrived, it was plated.",
Zqroe_hKmfu2gg_wv7Aw-w,2,A staff member proceeded to transfer all of my food from the plates to takeout containers.,
Zqroe_hKmfu2gg_wv7Aw-w,2,He was not wearing gloves or a hair net.,
Zqroe_hKmfu2gg_wv7Aw-w,2,"Although his hands could've been clean, this is highly unsanitary.",
Zqroe_hKmfu2gg_wv7Aw-w,2,"After finishing with my food, I definitely saw him scratch his head and not wash his hands so I'm doubtful that there were any hygiene practices in place.",
Zqroe_hKmfu2gg_wv7Aw-w,2,"From previous trips, I have not been super impressed with BurgerPalace",
Zqroe_hKmfu2gg_wv7Aw-w,2,"Their mozzarella sticks were notably crispy, but otherwise average, though they did come in a generous portion.",
Zqroe_hKmfu2gg_wv7Aw-w,2,Their spinach artichoke dip was not very flavorful.,
Zqroe_hKmfu2gg_wv7Aw-w,2,"Their soft pretzels sticks were tasty, but the cheese sauce that came with it was congealed and hard to dip into.",
Zqroe_hKmfu2gg_wv7Aw-w,2,"Also nothing special about their breadsticks, though the butter sauce on the side was a nice touch.",
Zqroe_hKmfu2gg_wv7Aw-w,2,"If you're looking for food of this type, I'd stick with TGI Fridays and Applebee's for better quality.",
nikUUdgxj4wKAIZZICcFMw,3,Burgers and fries were good.,
nikUUdgxj4wKAIZZICcFMw,3,The salad bar was a bit messy and not the selection it used to be (plus it's more expensive when swapped out as a side).Service,
nikUUdgxj4wKAIZZICcFMw,3,was just ok.,
nikUUdgxj4wKAIZZICcFMw,3,The impressive part was the manager was doing everything he could to get things moving from delivering food to stocking salad bar.,
etL3kbzsqTbFWyGNY8A9Yw,2,Tables were dirty and even the salt shaker had.,
etL3kbzsqTbFWyGNY8A9Yw,2,Sticky film on it.,
etL3kbzsqTbFWyGNY8A9Yw,2,Food was mediocre and won't go again.,
tYBXCs6ShhWIqCl7lEDAvw,2,This place went downhill,
tYBXCs6ShhWIqCl7lEDAvw,2,I went in excited and ordered some spinach and artichoke dip for an appetizer and placed an order for a pulled pork sandwiches well.,
tYBXCs6ShhWIqCl7lEDAvw,2,We got the appetizer and ate all of it and then the server came out like 25 minutes later to deliver my boyfriends food and tell me that there was no pulled pork.,
tYBXCs6ShhWIqCl7lEDAvw,2,I just made a salad at the salad bar at that point but why would you wait till his food comes out to tell me?,
tYBXCs6ShhWIqCl7lEDAvw,2,I thought that was insane.,
tYBXCs6ShhWIqCl7lEDAvw,2,And it looked very dirty in there anyways.,
ibHxMZrrDurQlkxcPN8qCw,1,Went here tonight and left before a server even came up to me and my granddaughter!,
ibHxMZrrDurQlkxcPN8qCw,1,!,
ibHxMZrrDurQlkxcPN8qCw,1,!,
ibHxMZrrDurQlkxcPN8qCw,1,Salad bar was not taken care of and waited 30 minutes and no server ever even greeted me or got us water!!!,
ibHxMZrrDurQlkxcPN8qCw,1,Nothing!!,
ibHxMZrrDurQlkxcPN8qCw,1,Waste of time!!,
WqMsv5rOyGoGMDJYLdOo1g,1,Food is good as usual but the stale musty smell coming from the salad bar (works underneath??) makes eating here difficult.,
WqMsv5rOyGoGMDJYLdOo1g,1,Management needs to get that fixed!!,
WqMsv5rOyGoGMDJYLdOo1g,1,"Tables, walls and booths stained as well as chairs.",
WqMsv5rOyGoGMDJYLdOo1g,1,Cutlery covered with dishwasher spots.,
WqMsv5rOyGoGMDJYLdOo1g,1,Holes in carpet under tables.,
WqMsv5rOyGoGMDJYLdOo1g,1,This place is in serious need of updates!,
WqMsv5rOyGoGMDJYLdOo1g,1,Won't return until it's done.,
ueS6mWsgLJnFZ20_AX4u_Q,5,Still love it the cheesesteak deal was great.,

dOc4eluSUEkVyQTDqjIcNQ,1,"Gag,,, Thought would give BurgerPalace another try....",
dOc4eluSUEkVyQTDqjIcNQ,1,Had a club soda at the bar and left.,
dOc4eluSUEkVyQTDqjIcNQ,1,It appear the bar area and floors have not been cleaned in years....,
dOc4eluSUEkVyQTDqjIcNQ,1,it smells and my feet stuck to the floor... gag gag...,
BzhAiszkcQHJU195hOq5NA,5,We decided to stop in here after shopping.,
BzhAiszkcQHJU195hOq5NA,5,It was delicious!,
BzhAiszkcQHJU195hOq5NA,5,Our steaks were cooked to perfect temp and tender!,
BzhAiszkcQHJU195hOq5NA,5,Highly recommend!,
5Kr_J6wCv6EP84Q_8iIrKg,3,I specifically came here an early dinner because I found an unused gift card purchased years ago.,
5Kr_J6wCv6EP84Q_8iIrKg,3,I appreciate that the gift card did not expire and it was accepted without issue.,
5Kr_J6wCv6EP84Q_8iIrKg,3,We ordered the ribs and the pulled pork.,
5Kr_J6wCv6EP84Q_8iIrKg,3,The pork was a bit messed and the taste was mediocre.,
5Kr_J6wCv6EP84Q_8iIrKg,3,The sauce on the ribs was decent and the meat was tender.,
5Kr_J6wCv6EP84Q_8iIrKg,3,The service was attentive until it was time to pay.,
5Kr_J6wCv6EP84Q_8iIrKg,3,Somehow we could not get our server's attention when we wanted the check.,
5Kr_J6wCv6EP84Q_8iIrKg,3,"When we finally flagged her down, she quickly processed our check and the gift card was swiped with no issue.",
5Kr_J6wCv6EP84Q_8iIrKg,3,I would not eat food from the buffet as I noticed adults and kids touching the buffet serving utensils without them being sanitized.,
5Kr_J6wCv6EP84Q_8iIrKg,3,The decor seemed a bit outdated and some of the wall wood paneling was worn on the edges.,
nPG_18ZH4NJExljCYAUyOg,4,"While the food was good and hot, RT was a bit stingy with the soup portion and coleslaw portion sizes.",
nPG_18ZH4NJExljCYAUyOg,4,All else ok.,
nPG_18ZH4NJExljCYAUyOg,4,Would order from RT again,
afjXSNFsYTdwfQzd9paiKg,2,I placed an order online.,
afjXSNFsYTdwfQzd9paiKg,2,Pulled up to this sign and called.,
afjXSNFsYTdwfQzd9paiKg,2,They don't answer the phone.,
afjXSNFsYTdwfQzd9paiKg,2,"So, instead of a curb side pick up, i have to go in.",
afjXSNFsYTdwfQzd9paiKg,2,That's what i was trying to avoid.,
afjXSNFsYTdwfQzd9paiKg,2,No hostess on duty.,
afjXSNFsYTdwfQzd9paiKg,2,A very nervous young man is made to deliver bad news to the customer ahead of me.,
afjXSNFsYTdwfQzd9paiKg,2,They left exasperated.,
afjXSNFsYTdwfQzd9paiKg,2,"The manager doesn't answer the phone, schedule a hostess or deliver his own bad news.",
afjXSNFsYTdwfQzd9paiKg,2,The food was good but i want my tip back.,
zEmJx7LvNpNwd8MK5KHoZw,2,This review is somewhere between 2 and 3 stars.,
zEmJx7LvNpNwd8MK5KHoZw,2,The restaurant was very outdated and smelled of wet carpet.,
zEmJx7LvNpNwd8MK5KHoZw,2,"The staff was friendly enough and efficient, my food came in a reasonable amount of time.",
zEmJx7LvNpNwd8MK5KHoZw,2,My burger wasn't seasoned and the cook must have smashed all the juice out of the burger because it was dry and overcooked.,
zEmJx7LvNpNwd8MK5KHoZw,2,"I am not usually that fussy about my burger, somewhere between raw and burnt is usually good enough.",
zEmJx7LvNpNwd8MK5KHoZw,2,If the cook had got the burger right they would have got the extra star.,
zEmJx7LvNpNwd8MK5KHoZw,2,Just mediocre at best.,
XQANBv-j7AH_G4EUcmuJTw,3,"BurgerPalace is my place to eat after dialysis, the service is good and food excellent.",
XQANBv-j7AH_G4EUcmuJTw,3,We went today and was in the mood for a good hamburger.,
XQANBv-j7AH_G4EUcmuJTw,3,Since I don't cook anymore i decided to order 2/$22 for my lunch and dinner.,
XQANBv-j7AH_G4EUcmuJTw,3,My servicer was Megan K and I told her I wanted rare cheeseburger for lunch and bring my pasta home.,
XQANBv-j7AH_G4EUcmuJTw,3,She comes out with my pasta and put it in front of me.,
XQANBv-j7AH_G4EUcmuJTw,3,I told no I want my pasta to go home and have my hamburger now.,
XQANBv-j7AH_G4EUcmuJTw,3,We also order mozzarella stick which still didn't come out yet.,
XQANBv-j7AH_G4EUcmuJTw,3,The girl at the checkin was running around cleaning all the tables.,
XQANBv-j7AH_G4EUcmuJTw,3,"I know restaurant are suffering, so make it right.",
XQANBv-j7AH_G4EUcmuJTw,3,"After my hamburger the waitress told those customers there was no cook, so that explains the delay and bad service.",
XQANBv-j7AH_G4EUcmuJTw,3,I will go again and hope service gets better.,
hppcsvOv9-okrGt1ZXD3bQ,2,We arrived in town this afternoon and decided ro try your Restaurant.,
hppcsvOv9-okrGt1ZXD3bQ,2,I ordered the blackened shrimp and sausage.,
hppcsvOv9-okrGt1ZXD3bQ,2,It was delicious but very skimpy on the shrimp and sausage.,
hppcsvOv9-okrGt1ZXD3bQ,2,My wife ordered the grilled chicken Cobb salad and asked for NO EGGS.,
hppcsvOv9-okrGt1ZXD3bQ,2,We waited 15-20 minutes for our food to arrive.,
hppcsvOv9-okrGt1ZXD3bQ,2,The salad had EGGS ON IT.,
hppcsvOv9-okrGt1ZXD3bQ,2,And there was no dressing.,
hppcsvOv9-okrGt1ZXD3bQ,2,She took it back and we waited over 20 minutes before she brought her salad with no eggs.,
hppcsvOv9-okrGt1ZXD3bQ,2,By this time I had already eaten my entree.,
hppcsvOv9-okrGt1ZXD3bQ,2,We came very close to canceling her order and leaving.,
hppcsvOv9-okrGt1ZXD3bQ,2,The restaurant was not very busy.,
hppcsvOv9-okrGt1ZXD3bQ,2,Our waitress was evidently new.,
hppcsvOv9-okrGt1ZXD3bQ,2,She never asked what type of dressing up front.,
hppcsvOv9-okrGt1ZXD3bQ,2,We had to point out our entrees on the menu for her when we ordered.,
8xZj9loBF0GNZNita5CE0A,1,My baked potato had been sitting under a heat light for most of the day.,
8xZj9loBF0GNZNita5CE0A,1,Was so over cooked it was terrible.,
8xZj9loBF0GNZNita5CE0A,1,Husbands steak was nowhere near the size he ordered.,
8xZj9loBF0GNZNita5CE0A,1,His baked potato was like mine and was half the size of mine.,
soXseS5rConQyAg3UI2TRg,1,Ewwwww grosss y'all are nasty.,
soXseS5rConQyAg3UI2TRg,1,Who's the cook?,
soXseS5rConQyAg3UI2TRg,1,A literal child?,
soXseS5rConQyAg3UI2TRg,1,How do you mess up chicken tenders?,
YyBY1khkvdMgb5Cbg4MwrA,2,We have lived in Vero for 4 years now.,
YyBY1khkvdMgb5Cbg4MwrA,2,We have frequented this restaurant usually twice a month.,
YyBY1khkvdMgb5Cbg4MwrA,2,Today 1/10/21 we ordered on line for pick up at 6:00.,
YyBY1khkvdMgb5Cbg4MwrA,2,Getting there on time I found the bar where you pick up orders totally crowded.,
YyBY1khkvdMgb5Cbg4MwrA,2,There were at least 7 take out bags behind the bar.,
YyBY1khkvdMgb5Cbg4MwrA,2,The bartender was overwhelmed by the crowd but was very disorganized.,
YyBY1khkvdMgb5Cbg4MwrA,2,"No one was ordering drinks, just all waiting for orders.",
YyBY1khkvdMgb5Cbg4MwrA,2,At 6:30 someone finally came out to help.,
YyBY1khkvdMgb5Cbg4MwrA,2,She checked for my order but it was not ready yet.,
YyBY1khkvdMgb5Cbg4MwrA,2,She went back in the kitchen and did not come back.,
YyBY1khkvdMgb5Cbg4MwrA,2,I ripped up my ticket and left it on the bar.,
YyBY1khkvdMgb5Cbg4MwrA,2,If they are that short handed they should not be sending out coupons.,
YyBY1khkvdMgb5Cbg4MwrA,2,We will not be back.,
u4bcnBDF0wTraNW_sfBaLw,5,My classmate and I were super satisfied with our 2 for $22 dinner!,
u4bcnBDF0wTraNW_sfBaLw,5,We are staying here from out of town and after a long day at the hospital the BurgerPalace looked promising (being just about in the same parking lot as well).,
u4bcnBDF0wTraNW_sfBaLw,5,"We ordered the baked pretzels, the cheese sauce was yummy!",
u4bcnBDF0wTraNW_sfBaLw,5,"Got a delicious American burger, cooked perfectly, grilled zucchini, and a sirloin steak with some crispy sweet potato fries and a loaded baker!",
u4bcnBDF0wTraNW_sfBaLw,5,"We were happy to sit and enjoy our drinks, a Strawberry Rose Sangria an Island Mai Tai.",
u4bcnBDF0wTraNW_sfBaLw,5,"The server, Brooke, took great care of us and was very knowledgeable and kind.",

uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,Tonight was very disappointing.,
uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,The restaurant was busy.,
uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,"Our waitress, Nancy was excellent.",
uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,But the food was not even near par.,
uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,"The steaks we ordered were very thin cut, a little more cooked than we usually get, but I'm sure that's because they were cut so thin.",
uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,"The French fries were cold and stale tasting, we did get a second batch which was better.",
uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,"The restaurant was out of baked potatoes at 6:00 which shouldn't happen, they don't go bad that quickly that you can't keep extra on hand.",
uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,"There was just no leadership in the kitchen, a lot of people complaining about the wait time for the food and then the food.",
uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,"So sorry to see this happen, we are regulars and we don't want to see this BurgerPalace close but if this keeps happening people will no longer come here.",
uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,Please try harder to regain control.,
uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,Better cooks needed.,
uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,"Our last visit was just as bad, food wise.",
uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,Not that it affected us but the bartender shouldn't be the one fixing Togo orders when there are people at the bar and in the dining area waiting for drinks.,
uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,If it wasn't for Nancy we might not come back.,
uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,Nancy is our only reason for returning.,
uwHmSOBTBorqZkIWgpWR1g,3,Very disappointed.,
63aKaEZuSdJFWYDgY-4zuw,1,"Well let start by saying everything was cold, then I called because they forgot our appetizer.",
63aKaEZuSdJFWYDgY-4zuw,1,Pretty much was told that if I wanted my correct food I could come pick it up.,
63aKaEZuSdJFWYDgY-4zuw,1,"Btw we used door dash, and we all know it's not doordash fault because of the BurgerPalace staff hands them the food closed-up due to the covid.",
63aKaEZuSdJFWYDgY-4zuw,1,I've been in this restaurant business for over 20 years and never as a manager what a guest ever hear me say to the host or whom ever answer the phone tell her if they want it don't have to come and get it well guess what BurgerPalace we never want it again since it was in complete an incorrect thank you so much for making our vacation horrible,

ZwKgo60A5rXtvs8wq7yPtA,2,"The food was OK, the service was absolutely terrible.",
ZwKgo60A5rXtvs8wq7yPtA,2,"Restaurant was FAR from full or even more than 6 customers so to not have a server check on how anything was going showed the didn't care, especially when the employees are yelling and cursing across the restaurant having personal conversations walking past tables.",
ZwKgo60A5rXtvs8wq7yPtA,2,I waited more than enough time to even receive silverware to eat my pasta.,
ZwKgo60A5rXtvs8wq7yPtA,2,& the sausage was DISGUSTING completely Oily I removed every piece of sausage out.,
ZwKgo60A5rXtvs8wq7yPtA,2,The waitress also had our food sitting because when it came out it had the film layer on the food when it starts getting cold from sitting out,
uO9zg800nLYlWGBuhb_xzQ,5,We had the best time at BurgerPalace in Clinton.,
uO9zg800nLYlWGBuhb_xzQ,5,"The food was good and I looooved the bottomless salad bar, but it was the INCREDIBLE service by a jack of all trades named K.C. that made our visit exceptional.",
uO9zg800nLYlWGBuhb_xzQ,5,He greeted us right away with sincerity and a professional joy rarely seen in hosts these days.,
uO9zg800nLYlWGBuhb_xzQ,5,He made sure to take care of every need and somehow returned to our table multiple times to check on us despite handling so many other things in the restaurant.,
uO9zg800nLYlWGBuhb_xzQ,5,"Not only was K.C. a serious multi-tasker, he was a genuine people person and clearly invested in creating a wonderful experience for every guest.",
uO9zg800nLYlWGBuhb_xzQ,5,It is rare to see this level of customer service nowadays.,

slTBYzhUlwkwN62yU0gDWw,1,We were seated almost 20 min ago.,
slTBYzhUlwkwN62yU0gDWw,1,1st of all the host sat us a dirty table which I had to ask her to wipe off!,
slTBYzhUlwkwN62yU0gDWw,1,Then we waited 10 min for a waited and the side we were on there was only one other table with guest!,

slTBYzhUlwkwN62yU0gDWw,1,As I'm posting this the tables still have NOT been cleaned!,

6ECeJzXgKQwMOxR4ha8Smw,4,Love ordering food for my family for delivery here.,
6ECeJzXgKQwMOxR4ha8Smw,4,Haven't had many issues other then food being cold or prepared wrong.,
6ECeJzXgKQwMOxR4ha8Smw,4,Usually they're pretty good with fixing those things thought.,
ZMO89FItV7a2JB7oU032Ug,1,We had hope for this outing.,
ZMO89FItV7a2JB7oU032Ug,1,Our first sign to leave was the seeing a cook smoking near the front of the restaurant.,
ZMO89FItV7a2JB7oU032Ug,1,Our server begged us to pay in cash and promised a free appetizer...,
ZMO89FItV7a2JB7oU032Ug,1,Repeatedly harped on it.,
ZMO89FItV7a2JB7oU032Ug,1,I used to be such a fan of the salad bar.,
ZMO89FItV7a2JB7oU032Ug,1,I ordered the salad bar with soup.,
ZMO89FItV7a2JB7oU032Ug,1,"The salad bar was full of wilted, mushy vegetables that had gone bad, along with over saturated macaroni and potato salads.",
ZMO89FItV7a2JB7oU032Ug,1,"The server forgot my soup, but I should have known that was a sign to not consume it -- it was a premade, bagged soup.",
ZMO89FItV7a2JB7oU032Ug,1,"He said the cook forgot it but by the time it made it to the table, it had a layer of film over the top.",
ZMO89FItV7a2JB7oU032Ug,1,I almost ordered a burger but glad I didn't because my mother-in-law's burger made her sick.,
ZMO89FItV7a2JB7oU032Ug,1,I'm really sorry this restaurant went downhill; it used to be so good.,
ZMO89FItV7a2JB7oU032Ug,1,Not sure how they will recover.,
kpnD-rlpk5cVU4ii-BEpOQ,4,Was reading reviews and was a little nervous but went in optimistic with the good ones in mind!,
kpnD-rlpk5cVU4ii-BEpOQ,4,"glad i did, my mom and i had an amazing time!",
kpnD-rlpk5cVU4ii-BEpOQ,4,pretty sure our servers name was alex and she was a sweetheart!,
kpnD-rlpk5cVU4ii-BEpOQ,4,made sure we had everything we needed and kept the refills coming!,
kpnD-rlpk5cVU4ii-BEpOQ,4,"food was pretty good too, i got the hickory bourbon chicken with mashed potatoes and upgraded to a premium side and got the mac and cheese.",
kpnD-rlpk5cVU4ii-BEpOQ,4,"couldn't pass up also getting the garden salad bar, it's always been my mom and I's favorite!",
kpnD-rlpk5cVU4ii-BEpOQ,4,my mom got the classic cheeseburger with fries and the salad bar.,
kpnD-rlpk5cVU4ii-BEpOQ,4,"do have to recommend getting the salad bar when you go, it's just unbeatable.",
kpnD-rlpk5cVU4ii-BEpOQ,4,only reason i'm giving a four star instead of a 5 was because the mac and cheese was a little bland and a tad cold in certain places when it got to us for some reason.,
kpnD-rlpk5cVU4ii-BEpOQ,4,also had the birthday cake to go and honestly if you enjoy cake it's to die for!,
kpnD-rlpk5cVU4ii-BEpOQ,4,all in all had a pretty good experience and can see myself driving back up to have another experience there!,
#NAME?,1,Placed order on line for curbside service.,

bzzSHaEjcg-DOCBto11NAQ,5,My husband and I chose to go out to eat tonight.,
bzzSHaEjcg-DOCBto11NAQ,5,Our waitress was Amanda.,
bzzSHaEjcg-DOCBto11NAQ,5,This young lady was so pleasant and very professional.,
bzzSHaEjcg-DOCBto11NAQ,5,There's such a grace about her in how she takes care of each individual table and person.,
bzzSHaEjcg-DOCBto11NAQ,5,Amanda's attentiveness was Awesome!!!,
bzzSHaEjcg-DOCBto11NAQ,5,"This girl deserves a raise, promotion or something!",
bzzSHaEjcg-DOCBto11NAQ,5,Been a while since we've had customer service like that.,
bzzSHaEjcg-DOCBto11NAQ,5,The person who restocked the salad bar was also pleasant.,
bzzSHaEjcg-DOCBto11NAQ,5,Worth a revisit...,
5c4NRlU2n9Ox2YMVLzAM2Q,1,Service here is terrible.,
5c4NRlU2n9Ox2YMVLzAM2Q,1,Got seated at a booth in the bar and sat for 10 minutes before a server approached us.,
5c4NRlU2n9Ox2YMVLzAM2Q,1,Our drink order took another 10 minutes to be delivered to the table.,
5c4NRlU2n9Ox2YMVLzAM2Q,1,Our food order was not correctly cooked to the desired temps.,
5c4NRlU2n9Ox2YMVLzAM2Q,1,Overall bad experience,
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,My expectations weren't very high considering all these reviews.,
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,"However, if I had to starve or eat at this establishment again, I'd starve.",
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,"There are many factors that made me decide to steer nearly every single person considering going to this establishment far, far away.",
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,Cleanliness:,
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,I don't think there are enough staff members to keep this place clean.,
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,It's apparent that they're overwhelmed by the patrons that decided to visit this establishment.,
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,"It needs a thorough power washing and bleaching, as well as an overhaul on the tables and seats.",
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,1/5 stars.,
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,"The reason they get 1 star, my table wasn't wobbly.",
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,Service:,
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,"Unfortunately, I don't think our server was ever properly trained.",
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,"We continuously had other peoples food coming to our table, we had our food going to other tables--our drinks took well over 20 minutes to arrive, and they weren't anything extravagant.",
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,Orders weren't correct and the wait was excruciatingly long.,
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,"If we didn't opt to get the salad bar, we would have sat waiting for our food for 48 minutes.",
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,"Again, nothing too difficult was ordered.",
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,0/5 stars...,
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,I could have done a better job with no training and provided our table with better service than we received.,
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,Food:,
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,I'm not quite sure how I managed to eat half of my burger or how my friend managed to eat what we called mysterymeattacodillas.,
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,"The other item ordered was the Triple Play, and the shrimp that came with it tasted as if it was bought from the grocery store frozen section, ribs were dry and didn't even look edible.",
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,"The salad bar held us over, but it was not refreshed, bowls were bare from the time we arrived until the time we left.",
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,Half of our items were under heat lamps for at least 5 minutes.,
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,"Again, not expecting much, but this really was a terrible experience.",
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,"1/5 stars, because our French fries were fresh.",
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,It's pretty hard to mess French fries up though...,
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,It took over 20 minutes to be able to pay our bill.,
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,Our server didn't have any idea how to reconcile our checks and repeatedly told us a manager was coming to assist.,
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,"No manager ever showed up, and we pretty much had to figure out their ""cash register"" device ourselves and just sort it out.",
bjK5HFMr8hz1lANlHc7VIA,1,Save yourself from the aggravation and find a locally owned restaurant to go.,
n6J9TEkthn9OqYU5JyO6Zg,1,Service is horrendous!,
n6J9TEkthn9OqYU5JyO6Zg,1,The bartender who works on Friday nights is rude.,
n6J9TEkthn9OqYU5JyO6Zg,1,,
n6J9TEkthn9OqYU5JyO6Zg,1,Making the atmosphere miserable.,
n6J9TEkthn9OqYU5JyO6Zg,1,Food was cold when served.,
n6J9TEkthn9OqYU5JyO6Zg,1,It's a shame this is the only restaurant close to the airport.,
n6J9TEkthn9OqYU5JyO6Zg,1,A lot of these customers are just passing through.,
n6J9TEkthn9OqYU5JyO6Zg,1,Thank you BurgerPalace for a great welcome!,
n6J9TEkthn9OqYU5JyO6Zg,1,Not recommending this place.,
n6J9TEkthn9OqYU5JyO6Zg,1,Higher new management,
YIMmaTmZBVcUX8r0x3RxDw,5,"Had great service, great food, and great times with family tonight at this restaurant!",
YIMmaTmZBVcUX8r0x3RxDw,5,They were busy but very attentive and the food was good.,
YIMmaTmZBVcUX8r0x3RxDw,5,Price was amazing also!,
YIMmaTmZBVcUX8r0x3RxDw,5,I would definitely say give it a try even though previous reviews might deter you from visiting.,
YIMmaTmZBVcUX8r0x3RxDw,5,We really had a great time and Chris our waiter was tremendous!,
hAVz6u-gXZQ32zwZFcqQ5g,2,Took 20 min just for waiter to ask us for drinks maybe cuz we were dressed weird was not busy.,
hAVz6u-gXZQ32zwZFcqQ5g,2,Took equally amount as long to get the drinks my food was hard never knew brisket is that hard to cheer waitress never came back once to ask us if we needed anything and had the nerve to watch us to see how much tip we were leaving on the screen avoid this place if you can,
QwIJvf3Jgvk3GOpr515nJw,1,"We asked for a table for 5 - we were 2 Americans, 2 Mexicans and a Mayan from Guatemala.",
QwIJvf3Jgvk3GOpr515nJw,1,"We waited 20 minutes in a pretty empty restaurant for a server who was disrespectful and said and chicken or steak would ""take a long time"" because we were ""not a priority of the kitchen"".",
QwIJvf3Jgvk3GOpr515nJw,1,It was 3:10pm and there were few people in a very large restaurant.,
QwIJvf3Jgvk3GOpr515nJw,1,Why?,
QwIJvf3Jgvk3GOpr515nJw,1,Racism?,
QwIJvf3Jgvk3GOpr515nJw,1,We were all speaking g Spanish.,
QwIJvf3Jgvk3GOpr515nJw,1,We got up and left.,
QwIJvf3Jgvk3GOpr515nJw,1,We will never go back there.,
84Axk_ktRs2_l91PcaMlug,5,"Well the reviews here are low, but I found myself at a nearby hotel at 7:30pm on a Tuesday with no car.",
84Axk_ktRs2_l91PcaMlug,5,I walked over and was pleasantly surprised.,
84Axk_ktRs2_l91PcaMlug,5,"Clean facility, got seated immediately, server was prompt, food was good.",
84Axk_ktRs2_l91PcaMlug,5,I went with a sirloin and rice/veggies.,
84Axk_ktRs2_l91PcaMlug,5,"It was cooked medium as requested, tender, and no excessive fat.",
84Axk_ktRs2_l91PcaMlug,5,I'm glad I came.,
84Axk_ktRs2_l91PcaMlug,5,You some come too.,
lmM8uILbEUPyj5IhBYwuTQ,1,Waiter at the bar was rude.. gave me molded fruit in my drink!,
lmM8uILbEUPyj5IhBYwuTQ,1,Took forever to even see if the table needed anything.,
lmM8uILbEUPyj5IhBYwuTQ,1,The salad bar was never refreshed.,
lmM8uILbEUPyj5IhBYwuTQ,1,The service here went downhill.,
TMVmZgWPLhNRu4RGr1-G7w,1,Terrible.,
TMVmZgWPLhNRu4RGr1-G7w,1,Got ribs and I Needed a chainsaw to eat them.,
TMVmZgWPLhNRu4RGr1-G7w,1,(I would have sent them back had I not gotten the to go) they went right in the trash.,
TMVmZgWPLhNRu4RGr1-G7w,1,Such a waste of money.,
TMVmZgWPLhNRu4RGr1-G7w,1,"Also, there was an extremely drunk guy sitting next to me at the bar while waiting on my food.",
TMVmZgWPLhNRu4RGr1-G7w,1,"He was clearly over served, could barely keep his eyes open and yet he was continually served.",
TMVmZgWPLhNRu4RGr1-G7w,1,"So sad because BurgerPalace used to be one of my favorite places. Now that I've thrown $25.00 of food in the trash, I'll never be back.",
zfigRebIgdfyqQGEQtw7Bw,2,"We got the salad bar, and the food tasted fine, but it was $13 just for the salad bar.",
zfigRebIgdfyqQGEQtw7Bw,2,"The prices were very high, I thought.",
zfigRebIgdfyqQGEQtw7Bw,2,They wanted $19.49 for a chicken sandwich and around $16 for a hamburger.,
zfigRebIgdfyqQGEQtw7Bw,2,"The restaurant was not very clean, and the bathroom was disgusting.",
zfigRebIgdfyqQGEQtw7Bw,2,"My fingers were sticking to the door when I entered, my feet were sticking to the floor when I walked in, and everything was very dirty.",
zfigRebIgdfyqQGEQtw7Bw,2,It looked like it wasn't cleaned in months.,
zfigRebIgdfyqQGEQtw7Bw,2,If you can find another option nearby you might want to try that.,
BsUeOe3iwl2X6xGhQweM0g,2,This restaurant was basically 50 feet away from the Hampton Inn so it was a no-brainer.,
BsUeOe3iwl2X6xGhQweM0g,2,I was a little concerned because all of the BurgerPalace in my area back towards Pittsburgh were closed so I thought they were all gone.,
BsUeOe3iwl2X6xGhQweM0g,2,"They're still cling to their stupid Covid policy and I may have had the most inexperienced waiter ever, the New Orleans seafood was supposed to come with two sides but it didn't and I basically shamed him into bringing rice.",
BsUeOe3iwl2X6xGhQweM0g,2,"I don't blame him, I blame the manager who did not train him and unleashed him on the public.",
BsUeOe3iwl2X6xGhQweM0g,2,Soon this BurgerPalace will be added to the list of closed restaurants.,
M8RmhI2pblxbmzGQzAMPVg,2,Not bad but definitely not the best.,
M8RmhI2pblxbmzGQzAMPVg,2,Sad to see that the BurgerPalace chain is slowly dying when they used to be really good!,
M8RmhI2pblxbmzGQzAMPVg,2,Salad bar increased in price while the food quality of it decreased.,
M8RmhI2pblxbmzGQzAMPVg,2,All of the plates were dirty for it & the lettuce was wilted.,
M8RmhI2pblxbmzGQzAMPVg,2,We ordered mild buffalo wings also with ranch.,
M8RmhI2pblxbmzGQzAMPVg,2,"Wings were alright but definitely some frozen brand, they always have a specific taste to them.",
M8RmhI2pblxbmzGQzAMPVg,2,Ranch wasn't its normal consistency it was watered down.,
M8RmhI2pblxbmzGQzAMPVg,2,Only reason for the 2 stars was our waiter was nice yet he was sitting at the bar while we were waiting for our check.,
M8RmhI2pblxbmzGQzAMPVg,2,Such a shame that this chain restaurant is going into the gutter.,
CohzsrDlYZvaOsnwD3IxQg,3,The salad bar at BurgerPalace is very good.,
CohzsrDlYZvaOsnwD3IxQg,3,If you have kids it's a good spot for a quick meal.,
CohzsrDlYZvaOsnwD3IxQg,3,"Probably would go to a more upscale for a date night, but for a fast, decent family dinner it's good.",
ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1,Horrible!!!,
ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1,"Not necessarily our waitresses fault, but partially.",
ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1,"3 tables sitting including us another couple walked in, by this time we had our drinks and ordered.",
ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1,The other two tables had their food already.,
ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1,"Table #4 got their food well before us, still not a horrible issue.",
ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1,"Finally our food starts to come out 2 of my 4 kids got mild wings, one came out Buffalo, child 3 got a burger, I got a quesadilla...",
ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1,the other 2 people (1 child and my husband) got no food.,
ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1,20 min passes and still no food!,
ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1,"We went to the bar and questioned 2x by now and was told the kitchen is slow, we are the ONLY table in the restaurant with no food!",
ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1,"We didn't see our waitress in this 20 min span, I went to the waitress station and got napkins and ketchup, I also went and got a rag from another table that still wasn't bussed or wiped when we had a spill and cleaned the mess up.",
ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1,No management skills at this location at all!,
ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1,This should not be acceptable at any business much less a restaurant.,
ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1,"When the remaining food did arrive it was inedible, my husband couldn't even bite through his chicken sandwich because it was so over cooked, the youngest child's pasta and sauce was ice cold and the fries tasted as if they were left from the day before.",
ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1,Items on the salad bar actually had ice on them as if they were frozen.,
ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1,"We could see at least 3-4 people in the kitchen so actually making edible food (burgers, sandwiches, wings and kid pasta) shouldn't be challenging.",
ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1,And after everything we still got a bill for $100+. Now everyone is hungry and it's only 30 min later because everyone's food was disgusting.,
ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1,,
ejsAa83zCmEXUQlCcYv05Q,1,Stay away,
c7NxzBKwOaNRgjUK_BE4IA,1,I would give a zero if I could on this visitPlaced a doordash order since I was in the middle of a few things...,

9PsPS1-TJZIi1iiPw7Zp8A,1,So we just left.,
9PsPS1-TJZIi1iiPw7Zp8A,1,We got seated after going into bar area so bartender could see us.,
9PsPS1-TJZIi1iiPw7Zp8A,1,"Sat at the table for over 15 minutes and nobody came to ask about drinks, take order nothing.",
9PsPS1-TJZIi1iiPw7Zp8A,1,"Looked at the salad bar which used to be our favorite, now it's pretty bland and not good.",
9PsPS1-TJZIi1iiPw7Zp8A,1,This is the ladt time we try BurgerPalace,
9PsPS1-TJZIi1iiPw7Zp8A,1,"Such a shame we used to like to ho there, well to the Montgomeryville location but it closed.",
9PsPS1-TJZIi1iiPw7Zp8A,1,What waste of our time.,
9PsPS1-TJZIi1iiPw7Zp8A,1,There was only 7 tables at the time we were there.,
kYjEaAs3DPTfb36qYHS1YA,5,I was here on business and decided to grab a bit to eat .,
kYjEaAs3DPTfb36qYHS1YA,5,Being by myself you always feel A little awkward but when I went in I was greeted properly by server name Neil.,
kYjEaAs3DPTfb36qYHS1YA,5,He fortunately was my waiter also he greeted me with a smile and did not make me feel uncomfortable at all dinning by myself.,
kYjEaAs3DPTfb36qYHS1YA,5,I observed him taking care of all the other guest he was very accommodating and courteous very attentive you are very lucky to have him as a server Neil thank you,
dLLAkDVPTL3DOLw9bZQmiA,1,Don't waste your time.,
dLLAkDVPTL3DOLw9bZQmiA,1,I understand many establishments are experiencing staffing issue but this location has been pretty bad for years.,
dLLAkDVPTL3DOLw9bZQmiA,1,They really needs to adapt and adjust.,
dLLAkDVPTL3DOLw9bZQmiA,1,I stood in the hostess area for 15min and watched multiple servers walk right by me and not say a word.,
dLLAkDVPTL3DOLw9bZQmiA,1,,
dLLAkDVPTL3DOLw9bZQmiA,1,Left and will not be returning.,
#NAME?,5,Place was short staffed but they still managed to serve great food in a timely matter.,
#NAME?,5,Our server Neil was amazing.,
#NAME?,5,He had 5-6 tables he was serving and had a very upbeat and positive attitude.,
#NAME?,5,Definitely recommend this place if I'm the area.,
KQyI2KTLqPkzgs2S-ue1Iw,1,Service is terrible.,
KQyI2KTLqPkzgs2S-ue1Iw,1,Attitude is unnecessary.,
KQyI2KTLqPkzgs2S-ue1Iw,1,That was before I found out my soup was wrong and returned to have it corrected!,
KQyI2KTLqPkzgs2S-ue1Iw,1,1/2 cup of soup for 6.79 is a bit much too.,
KQyI2KTLqPkzgs2S-ue1Iw,1,Don't plan to visit.,
KQyI2KTLqPkzgs2S-ue1Iw,1,It's not worth it.,
KQyI2KTLqPkzgs2S-ue1Iw,1,Vinny should not be the pickup person.,
cnVNYPH00JH9HVu-Au3cCw,1,I'm only giving A one star because I can't give no stars this meal was awful the manager was rude and I do not recommend eating at this place,
UnGVBUBbWSVT-92IJgN6aA,4,I miss ours in TN so we decided to stop while visiting GA.,
UnGVBUBbWSVT-92IJgN6aA,4,Not a bad location.,
UnGVBUBbWSVT-92IJgN6aA,4,Accessible and good parking.,
UnGVBUBbWSVT-92IJgN6aA,4,Salad bar is still amazing.,
UnGVBUBbWSVT-92IJgN6aA,4,I only wish more salad bars had some fruit only because I like a little sweet with the salty.,
UnGVBUBbWSVT-92IJgN6aA,4,$11.99 for the endless bar is still an AMAZING deal.,

UnGVBUBbWSVT-92IJgN6aA,4,The salad bar was well stocked and appeared pretty fresh.,
UnGVBUBbWSVT-92IJgN6aA,4,We were the first customers of the day so no wait for seating.,
UnGVBUBbWSVT-92IJgN6aA,4,My husband had the grilled salmon with grilled zucchini which was also very flavorful and a good portion.,
UnGVBUBbWSVT-92IJgN6aA,4,Unfortunately I forgot to take pictures because we were so focused on eating.,

FE2NzeCoSa3USBeC_mD7AQ,3,Loved every ruby tuesday I have ever been to but tonight I was extremely disappointed.,
FE2NzeCoSa3USBeC_mD7AQ,3,Our family decided to order curbside pick up.,
FE2NzeCoSa3USBeC_mD7AQ,3,Easy ordering process we were told from the website our order would be ready 20 min after it was placed.,
FE2NzeCoSa3USBeC_mD7AQ,3,Pull up to the pick up order stall and no one picks up the phone wait another 20 min..,
FE2NzeCoSa3USBeC_mD7AQ,3,I finally decide to walk in.,
FE2NzeCoSa3USBeC_mD7AQ,3,"I was passed by several people when I waited, finally someone helped me to be told something I ordered wasn't available, not a big deal ordered something else.",
FE2NzeCoSa3USBeC_mD7AQ,3,Wasn't to bad of a wait but got home the food was extremely cold and my burger buns were burnt and my burger was raw.,
FE2NzeCoSa3USBeC_mD7AQ,3,If it wasn't for the fact that I know everyone is short staffed I'd give one star.,
FE2NzeCoSa3USBeC_mD7AQ,3,You may get better service and food if you dine in.,

3Fa9EoJhbGG_7wXmR4Xerw,4,"I had a fish fish the first time which was exceptionally tasty and I enjoyed it immensely, my wife ordered the chicken crunch and said it was fantastic! The second time we came I had a burger and the garlic parmesan wings...I didn't care for the wings and the burger was just ok...the salad bar is always great we had it both times everything appears fresh and crisp. The wait staff has been very friendly both times although it does appear they are under staffed due to the wait we had as the restaurant appeared empty but with the way things are nowadays it is happening everywhere...we will be back to try some new items",

lAkqOJKSnIGh_oFoAVf-Uw,1,"The brisket was old, it was turning a darker color on different places.",
lAkqOJKSnIGh_oFoAVf-Uw,1,It tasted like it was the one that you would get from Walmart in the meat section for the microwave.,
lAkqOJKSnIGh_oFoAVf-Uw,1,My sides were corn and backed beans.,
lAkqOJKSnIGh_oFoAVf-Uw,1,"For 1 they were cold and for 2, they tasted as if they came from a can.",
lAkqOJKSnIGh_oFoAVf-Uw,1,Tasted bland.,

OI2_F2orsrWTCh14gX2xoA,1,One cook had already walked out.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,Worst meal and service I can ever remember.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,I have never written a review before but just felt I owed it to the paying public this time.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,There was a sign on the door that the fryer was down so we couldn't order anything fried.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,At 1:00 on a Saturday afternoon there was only one other table seated when we arrived.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,Should have been my first clue.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,We were 2 adults and 2 children.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,The children ordered plain hamburgers and one also got the salad bar.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,One adult ordered the salad bar and I ordered broccoli cheese soup.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,"We also had 2 Cokes, 1 iced tea and a water.",
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,We waited well over an hour for the hamburgers and the soup.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,The soup was cold and had sat so long it had congealed on the top and shook like jello when I touched it.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,The waitress was still at the table and I asked her was it normal for the soup to be like that.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,She couldn't even be bothered to answer.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,I told her she could take it back which she did.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,"She didn't offer me an appology, a fresh bowl or a different menu item.",
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,Just left and never came back.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,We never were asked if the rest of the meal was ok or if we needed drink refills.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,"I wanted to walk out but we waited way, way to long for the check.",
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,I asked here if there was a manager and she said yes and turned around and went back in the kitchen.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,When the manager arrived I told her how bad everything had been.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,She said the soup was fine that it had just sat under a heat lamp.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,That could be true but it must have been there for an hour.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,Her idea of compensation was for me to give her my address and she would send me a discount for my next visit.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,I told her I was traveling and just passing through and I would not be coming back.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,I asked if there was anything she could do for us today since I didn't even get to eat anything after spending 1-1/2 hours in her fine establishment.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,"She said nope, sorry nothing she could do.",
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,I wouldn't send my worst enemy there.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,I can be very understanding that things happen but these guys didn't even try to care.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,The other adult in our party used the ladies room and said it was very dirty and had smeared feces everywhere.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,That's all I will say about that.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,"They blame so many problems on covid but they were not busy, only saw 3 takeout orders go past us during our 1-1/2 hrs, and the waitresses and hostess were just sitting in the bar area on their phones.",
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,A guy came out of the back with an apron on and a cigarette in his hand.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,He went outside and smoked right outside our window.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,I don't know if he was the cook and took a break or what.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,After we left I pulled up the reviews for this place and blame myself for even trying it.,
ncJvH5_l4daWwTUlrv7AVA,1,Don't say you haven't been warned.,
YguV3dKWyPqMGirtvyKYuw,1,You should be ashamed of yourselves 3rd partying for Wow Bao.,
YguV3dKWyPqMGirtvyKYuw,1,It's disgusting and tasted like bleach.,
YguV3dKWyPqMGirtvyKYuw,1,Are you guys trying to get my family sick?,
YguV3dKWyPqMGirtvyKYuw,1,Paid an arm and a leg for nothing.,

hnm9k28r39eyrO_-S1Se5w,2,"Though my meal was good and my daughter enjoyed her pasta, someone seemed to have dropped the ball in the presentation of my husband's meal.",
hnm9k28r39eyrO_-S1Se5w,2,"Usually, the veggies are separated for the to-go meals, especially when there is a sauce involved.",
hnm9k28r39eyrO_-S1Se5w,2,Who wants their veggies swimming in a sauce intended for the meat???,
hnm9k28r39eyrO_-S1Se5w,2,Just hurt looking at how this meal was prepared/packed for pick up.,
hnm9k28r39eyrO_-S1Se5w,2,My daughter picked up the order and didn't bother looking before leaving.,
hnm9k28r39eyrO_-S1Se5w,2,"If I had picked up the meals and noticed how my husband's meal was packed, I would have returned it.",

hnm9k28r39eyrO_-S1Se5w,2,Seems someone just didn't care when packing this meal.,
hnm9k28r39eyrO_-S1Se5w,2,I know there are plenty of problems in this world and having an abundance of bourbon sauce on one's broccoli may not be a big deal.,
hnm9k28r39eyrO_-S1Se5w,2,"But, for folks like me who like for the food to not only taste good but look good presentation-wise, I was a bit disappointed in BurgerPalace this time.",

wCOgIUFFAYeUf-NY5S6RHg,3,Pleasantly surprised.,
wCOgIUFFAYeUf-NY5S6RHg,3,When I called to ask about the particulars of the restaurant whether it's open for available dining inside or takeout and what time they close she had major attitude on the phone which almost made me not want to eat there I can understand it gets frustrating being called and asked the same thing over and over are you available to eat inside but what do you expect people are going to ask that until things go back to normal,
jR-Y3JhysTNYmqk8phM0WQ,4,"My normal favorite at BurgerPalace is the salad bar and French onion soup, so that's my go to meal for lunch.",

jR-Y3JhysTNYmqk8phM0WQ,4,Ribs and chicken were awesome.,

wLD6JNLUTDMHhq3ENn3cXw,5,She brought ice cream and a huge slice of cake for my 6 year old.,
wLD6JNLUTDMHhq3ENn3cXw,5,I began crying over her kindness because it had been a super hard day for us.,

ZKWKsbHQhLQbIKTfbfN9Gw,1,As u can see in the first photo one is the supposedly price they took off (29.48) and the second one is where they added all these little discounts which didn't add up to the discount they gave me...,

6ISImhlSw-8QwVX6Ng-pcg,5,The food was excellent!,
6ISImhlSw-8QwVX6Ng-pcg,5,Something about that Mac and Cheese is going to make me a frequent visitor.,

OTWZSJ3KZyb6eL9peDh3SA,4,They frequently send me deals by e-mail and we usually use them.,
OTWZSJ3KZyb6eL9peDh3SA,4,"I LOVE their salad bar--at the present time it is not self-serve because of Covid, but the servers give you an order form and do a good job of making it the way you want.",
OTWZSJ3KZyb6eL9peDh3SA,4,My favorite entreÃÅe is the Bourbon Salmon and my wife loves the Triple Play.,

TJmgG_zKE6Nboyn2uNmdBA,1,One Word - Depressing!This,
TJmgG_zKE6Nboyn2uNmdBA,1,BurgerPalace location is a manifestation of all the reasons why this once great casual dining chain entered bankruptcy.,
TJmgG_zKE6Nboyn2uNmdBA,1,My visit began in the parking lot which was littered with trash and in poor repair.,
TJmgG_zKE6Nboyn2uNmdBA,1,"Seriously, a freaking pothole smack dab in the middle.",
TJmgG_zKE6Nboyn2uNmdBA,1,Leadership isn't even trying.,
TJmgG_zKE6Nboyn2uNmdBA,1,To characterize the staff as lethargic would be an understatement.,
TJmgG_zKE6Nboyn2uNmdBA,1,"The food was, well, not even mediocre.",
TJmgG_zKE6Nboyn2uNmdBA,1,The bar had a very limited selection of beer and spirits.,
TJmgG_zKE6Nboyn2uNmdBA,1,,
TJmgG_zKE6Nboyn2uNmdBA,1,Remember when BurgerPalace's was a fun place to visit?,
TJmgG_zKE6Nboyn2uNmdBA,1,I got the sense that this location was about to be closed for good which would explain why their operations are so bad.,
TJmgG_zKE6Nboyn2uNmdBA,1,Just pull the plug and stop damaging the Brand.,
TJmgG_zKE6Nboyn2uNmdBA,1,As for a cure for the depression; we went across the street to Marble Slab and drowned our sorrows in Ice Cream.,
g6jhXN-NzpZ2sSB1Z8zxAw,5,An enjoyable place to be.,
g6jhXN-NzpZ2sSB1Z8zxAw,5,Recently remodeled and has an excellent Salad bar.,
g6jhXN-NzpZ2sSB1Z8zxAw,5,The food and drink was very good.,
w63azNuCyBOG2HhC04V8Lg,2,This BurgerPalace service was horrible and the good was just as bad.,
w63azNuCyBOG2HhC04V8Lg,2,The last time we went will be the last time.,
w63azNuCyBOG2HhC04V8Lg,2,Every body in the restaurant was complaining because it was so bad.,
kNoFeNPBL6hbdIk7kqrkVQ,1,"AWFUL, I say that loudly.",
kNoFeNPBL6hbdIk7kqrkVQ,1,This is my second time back hoping it would be better.,
kNoFeNPBL6hbdIk7kqrkVQ,1,But the management here lacks big time.,
kNoFeNPBL6hbdIk7kqrkVQ,1,"The server acted like he hated his job and everyone in the building, 100 empty tables and making people wait 30 minutes to be seated.",
kNoFeNPBL6hbdIk7kqrkVQ,1,I would recommend eating McDonald's in traffic then eating here.,
NHPt76thB-fDbbtTjyNIqg,4,This location has a pick up inside the store by the bar.,
NHPt76thB-fDbbtTjyNIqg,4,But they also have seating for dine in customers in that same area.,
NHPt76thB-fDbbtTjyNIqg,4,For some reason they said the dining customers in the exact same area repeat the lineup to pay for there to go order.,
NHPt76thB-fDbbtTjyNIqg,4,This is a conflict for the people who are trying to enjoy their dining meal.,
NHPt76thB-fDbbtTjyNIqg,4,It's a very busy area with people coming and going and paying.,
NHPt76thB-fDbbtTjyNIqg,4,The servers are hanging out in a booth in the back playing with the phones.,
NHPt76thB-fDbbtTjyNIqg,4,The other servers and bartenders are discussing inventory at the bar and going back-and-forth.,
NHPt76thB-fDbbtTjyNIqg,4,All in all it was very uncomfortable and not A quiet dinner with my husband.,
NHPt76thB-fDbbtTjyNIqg,4,on a positive note the chicken With fettuccine noodles and Parmesan sauce and broccoli was out of this world.,
NHPt76thB-fDbbtTjyNIqg,4,there was way too much of it for one person but I ate every bit of it anyway.,
FUb8FlSmpz_zsr7ZE_i61A,5,"When it comes to customer service, this location cannot be beat.",

FUb8FlSmpz_zsr7ZE_i61A,5,I called to let them know so that they could check if it was switched with another order.,
FUb8FlSmpz_zsr7ZE_i61A,5,They insisted on making it right for me.,
FUb8FlSmpz_zsr7ZE_i61A,5,"Since we were passing by the restaurant later in the evening, we stopped again.",
FUb8FlSmpz_zsr7ZE_i61A,5,"They even threw in some ""extras!""",

orerFVZdzM9pu4Ne1idNgA,5,What a great meal and it was very easy to pickup during the Coronavirus Pandemic.,

yAwELcElPUYkR-xFUedkfQ,2,They need a lot of updates/renovations on the inside.,
yAwELcElPUYkR-xFUedkfQ,2,,
yAwELcElPUYkR-xFUedkfQ,2,"Nothing was done to better the interior of the restaurant during the pandemic (messed up booth seats and table chairs, hole in the ceiling tile, dirty window(s), etc).",
yAwELcElPUYkR-xFUedkfQ,2,The only thing that was updated was the pay system - they now have a portable credit card machine that the waitstaff brings to the table.,
z_eCNpZ05AjaQCrrfJg9mQ,1,It is always a very long wait for your food.,
z_eCNpZ05AjaQCrrfJg9mQ,1,Always short staff.,

DpLExWLNJueJBcvsPNJe0Q,1,The food was terrible and the service was worse.,
DpLExWLNJueJBcvsPNJe0Q,1,Our server came over and instantly had a bad attitude from the beginning number 1.,
DpLExWLNJueJBcvsPNJe0Q,1,Number 2 we were never told that when the kitchen was closing so the food that I ordered never came.,
DpLExWLNJueJBcvsPNJe0Q,1,Then she says it did come out but was sent back but not by me.,
DpLExWLNJueJBcvsPNJe0Q,1,I also ordered desert when I ordered my meal and was told I couldn't get it because the kitchen was closed.,
DpLExWLNJueJBcvsPNJe0Q,1,How is that when I placed my order all at one time we ordered drinks that never came then when we asked about it she says ohh we don't have that ????,
DpLExWLNJueJBcvsPNJe0Q,1,Did not once come and say would u like something else.,
DpLExWLNJueJBcvsPNJe0Q,1,To top it off when it was time to pay she comes over throws our receipts on the floor and runs off .,
DpLExWLNJueJBcvsPNJe0Q,1,I was highly confused about what her problem was.,
DpLExWLNJueJBcvsPNJe0Q,1,But the kicker is the so called manager wasn't any better.,
DpLExWLNJueJBcvsPNJe0Q,1,He was just as nasty as the food they tried to serve us.,
DpLExWLNJueJBcvsPNJe0Q,1,I would never step foot in that place again.,
DpLExWLNJueJBcvsPNJe0Q,1,Worse place if I could give it 0 I would,

qDSFr1E1j01yAvpJb_sxIQ,4,The salad bar was very nice but she was disappointed that they did not have soup at this location.,
qDSFr1E1j01yAvpJb_sxIQ,4,"Her chicken sandwich looked way over cooked and came with no cheese or Lettuce, Tomato, Onion or Mayo, it came with just 2 pickles which also disappointed my wife but she made do by grabbing her condiments off of the salad bar.",
qDSFr1E1j01yAvpJb_sxIQ,4,"I ordered The Classic Cheeseburger medium rare w/ French fries well done, don't judge me, that's how I like it, LOL.",
qDSFr1E1j01yAvpJb_sxIQ,4,My burger was pretty good but the cheese was pretty much non existent and it lacked seasoning big time.,
qDSFr1E1j01yAvpJb_sxIQ,4,"My fries were great, nice and crispy, honestly the fries were the star of the show.",

GaKYoNh-denYTPr5BzVjLQ,2,First time I've been there in a while.,
GaKYoNh-denYTPr5BzVjLQ,2,They've tried to make salad bar safer but some of the staff needs to be schooled on how to properly wear their masks.,
GaKYoNh-denYTPr5BzVjLQ,2,Then my waitress messed up my order - gave it to someone else or something so I had to wait even longer because I wanted my food.,
GaKYoNh-denYTPr5BzVjLQ,2,"The food was ok and she did offer a comp desert, but I declined. Seems like they would have taken something off the check.",
