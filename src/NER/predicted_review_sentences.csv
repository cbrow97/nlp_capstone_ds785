ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,The place looked like the 90's called and wanted everything in the place back like stuck in 35 years ago kind of feel and look.,negative
ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,"The attempts to promote are a nice effort but seems so over blown ""Win a Million Dollars!""",negative
ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,But the risk is maybe ruin your health or get sick or just plain waste your money on substandard food?,negative
ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,"So our ""meal"" was not good from start to finish.",negative
ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,The staff needs some real training.,negative
ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,The training videos don't seem to be translating into real life results.,negative
ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,The thing that struck me was how can you be happy if the place is always kinda empty and the staff keeps getting cut and makes no money?,negative

ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,That did not say delicious food ahead.,negative
ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,What we discovered was we were wrong for not heeding this lil warning.,negative
ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,No attention at the front and waitresses looked at us but did nothing.,negative
ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,Great why make us wait that long when the place was so empty on a Friday night prime dinner time.,negative
ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,The service was not great but it was not the servers fault (We tipped strong because we feel her pain) but then the wait time for an empty restaurant seemed a bit long but not end of the world long.,negative
ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,The food however was a massive disappointment.,negative
ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig, I am in the wrong here too because I feel like if I am spending near $60 for a quick bite it should at least be pleasant and satisfying.,negative

ygfz2VvkgvC9eYxst8hGig,They need to call Robert Irvine from the Food TV Network to revamp everything or something.,negative

3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,"It was coffee, I guess, but litereally tasteless.",negative
3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,Then I ordered chicken tenders and CRISPY fries.,negative
3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,"If I order fries, I specifically order them well done because they are normally underdone no matter where you go and browning them negates some of the greasiness.",negative
3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,"Obviously, the waitress (yes, I use gender specific labels...sue me.",negative
3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,"I was a waitress for years and never took offense at being referred to as such) misunderstood my request and brought out a plate of rock-hard chicken tender-looking things with dried out, stringy white meat inside and a pile of underdone, whitish, mealy fries.",negative
3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,Even the GMO corn syrup-laden pseudo-ketchup didn't help.,negative
3QFvz5edaWmnbGwxyN6PNA,"The waitress was polite enough, but obviously over worked as she was serving at tables and behind the bar, then apparently forgot I was there and I had to stand up and leave the table to get her attention.",negative
